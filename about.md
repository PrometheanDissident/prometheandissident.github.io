I am interested in truth first and foremost.

Truth is inherently ambiguous, especially as it begins to pertain to the nature of humanity, and everything which revolves around that. Many things which were thought to be true in centuries past are now believed to be irrational and absurd by the average person today. And yet those of the past, despite living in different genetic and environmental circumstances, are still very similar to us. We should not automatically expect that modern societies would be perfectly rational when previous societies have not been.

I am therefore interested in deconstructing and reconstructing past and present understandings of society. While present cultural biases limit the analysis of society to ideas and environmental conditions, this ultimately fails to grasp the significance of the mediator between ideas and the environment: us. It’s as if we are endlessly attempting to understand the world through looking around at everything, yet cower at the mere reflection of ourselves in a mirror. A true holistic understanding of the world requires an integration of the ideal, material, and the biological.

Mainstream institutions tend to embody this cultural bias which shies away from understanding human societies using a biological lens. And because this value is so intensely held in many circumstances, it has proven difficult to change from within. I see my aim as creating alternative spaces and institutions where knowledge and ideas can be exchanged in a genuine academic search for truth.

Consider this website a space where I explore and discuss these ideas in more depth. In my exploration, I hope to provide the rigor I wish I saw more often employed in contemporary discourse.
