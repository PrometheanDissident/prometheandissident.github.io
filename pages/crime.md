## Punishment Practices

### Private Prisons

Probably cringe

Cost savings from private prisons are minimal to null, and quality of confinement is slightly better for publicly managed prisons, with slightly better skills training and slightly fewer inmate grievances<ref>Pratt, T. C., & Maahs, J. (1999). Are Private Prisons More Cost-Effective than Public Prisons? A Meta-Analysis of Evaluation Research Studies. Crime & Delinquency, 45(3), 358–371. https://doi.org/10.1177/0011128799045003004</ref><ref>Lundahl, B. W., Kunz, C., Brownell, C., Harris, N., & Van Vleet, R. (2009). Prison privatization. Research on Social Work Practice, 19(4), 383–394. https://doi.org/10.1177/1049731509331946</ref>. Private prison inmates tend to have higher recidivism<ref>Spivak, A. L., & Sharp, S. F. (2008). Inmate recidivism as a measure of private prison performance. Crime & Delinquency, 54(3), 482–508. https://doi.org/10.1177/0011128707307962</ref><ref>Duwe, G., & Clark, V. (2013). The effects of private prison confinement on offender recidivism. Criminal Justice Review, 38(3), 375–394. https://doi.org/10.1177/0734016813478823</ref>.

### Rehabilitation

Probably based

Restorative justice programs are significantly more effective in terms of victim and offender satisfaction, restitution compliance, and recidivism, although these are tempered by self-selection bias inherent in restorative justice research<ref>Latimer, J., Dowden, C., & Muise, D. (2005). The Effectiveness of Restorative Justice Practices: A Meta-Analysis. The Prison Journal, 85(2), 127–144. https://doi.org/10.1177/0032885505276969</ref>.

### Death Penalty

Gay and cringe

- **Deterrence: Null -** The consensus among criminologists is that the death penalty does not add any significant deterrent effect above that of long-term imprisonment<ref>Radelet, M. L., Ph. D., Lacock, T. L., Sheilah’s Fund, Tides Foundation, & Death Penalty Information Center. (2009). DO EXECUTIONS LOWER HOMICIDE RATES?: THE VIEWS OF LEADING CRIMINOLOGISTS. In Northwestern University, School of Law, THE JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL LAW & CRIMINOLOGY (Vol. 99, Issue 2, pp. 489–491). https://dpic-cdn.org/production/legacy/DeterrenceStudy2009.pdf</ref>. Empirical evidence also suggests that the death penalty has no deterrent effect on homicides<ref>Cochran, J. K., Chamlin, M. B., & Seth, M. (1994). DETERRENCE OR BRUTALIZATION? AN IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF OKLAHOMA’S RETURN TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT*. Criminology, 32(1), 107–134. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1994.tb01148.x</ref><ref>Zimring, F., Fagan, J., & Johnson, D. T. (n.d.). Executions, Deterrence and Homicide: A tale of two cities. Scholarship Archive. https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/1587/</ref>.
- **Cost: High -** Each death penalty inmate in the US is approximately $1.12 million (2015 USD) more than a general population inmate. This comes from more expensive living conditions, a much more extensive legal process, and increasing resistance to the death penalty from chemical manufacturers overseas<ref>The Death Penalty vs. Life Incarceration: A Financial Analysis. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324804378_The_Death_Penalty_vs_Life_Incarceration_A_Financial_Analysis</ref>.

## Police

Police force based

- **Police and Crime: Negative -** There is a small negative effect of the size of a police force and crime rates<ref>Police levels and crime: A systematic review and meta-analysis. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283449163_Police_levels_and_crime_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis</ref><ref>Conclusions from the history of research into the effects of police force size on crime—1968 through 2013: a historical systematic review. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306313431_Conclusions_from_the_history_of_research_into_the_effects_of_police_force_size_on_crime-1968_through_2013_a_historical_systematic_review?fbclid=IwAR35XEZ3UeuPrfampXDGjODOvBDPFw98u1kuXg9mAYinYUvrWqoHsCzYZd</ref>.
- **Hot Spots Policing and Crime: Negative -** Hot spots policing is effective in reducing crime<ref>Sci-Hub | Hot spots policing and crime reduction: an update of an ongoing systematic review and meta-analysis. Journal of Experimental Criminology | 10.1007/s11292-019-09372-3. (n.d.). https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11292-019-09372-3</ref>.
- **Community-Oriented Policing and Crime: Null (But Maybe Other Positives) -** Community-oriented policing can positively affect citizen satisfaction, perceptions of disorder, and police legitimacy, but it has limited effects on crime and fear of crime<ref>Gill, C., Weisburd, D., Telep, C. W., Vitter, Z., & Bennett, T. (2014). Community-oriented policing to reduce crime, disorder and fear and increase satisfaction and legitimacy among citizens: a systematic review. Journal of Experimental Criminology, 10(4), 399–428. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11292-014-9210-y</ref>.

## Crime

Predictors of Crime:
- **Lead Pollution -** Lead pollution has a small but statistically significant positive effect on crime<ref>Higney, A., Hanley, N., & Moro, M. (2022). The lead-crime hypothesis: A meta-analysis. Regional Science and Urban Economics, 97, 103826. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2022.103826</ref>.
- **Poverty/Inequality -** Both poverty and income inequality are associated with violent crime, with homicide and assault showing stronger associations than rape and robbery<ref>Sci-HuB | Poverty, Income Inequality, and Violent Crime: A Meta-Analysis of Recent Aggregate Data Studies. Criminal Justice Review, 18(2), 182–202 | 10.1177/073401689301800203. (n.d.). https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1177/073401689301800203</ref>. Poverty, social exclusion, wage and income inequality, cultural and family background, level of education, age, and sex contribute to violent crime<ref>Buonanno, P. (2003). The Socioeconomic Determinants of Crime. A Review of the literature. ideas.repec.org. https://ideas.repec.org/p/mib/wpaper/63.html</ref>. Higher social spending is associated with significantly lower crime, particularly homicide. This suggests that poverty itself is in fact an important predictor of criminality<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3097192</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235220300623#:~:text=The%20welfare%20state%20suppresses%20crime,have%20any%20effect%20on%20homicide.</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/coep.12522</ref><ref>https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/7/10/e016379.full.pdf</ref>.
- **Racial Heterogeneity -** Racial heterogeneity, poverty, and family disruption are strong and stable predictors of crime, while variables related to the use of the criminal justice system were weak predictors. Social disorganization and resource/economic deprivation theories received strong empirical support, while deterrence/rational choice and subcultural theories received weak support<ref>Sci-Hub | Assessing Macro-Level Predictors and Theories of Crime: A Meta-Analysis. Crime and Justice, 32, 373–450 | 10.1086/655357. (n.d.). https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1086/655357</ref>.

## Drug Policy

### Effect on Crime

**Enforcement increases crime, helps cartels**

Drug-related and gang-related homicides, as well as robberies, in states bordering Mexico with medical marijuana laws decreased following the passage of such laws. There was a decrease in the amount of cocaine seized and an increase in the price of cocaine, suggesting that such laws cripple drug-trafficking organizations who rely on revenue from marijuana<ref>Gavrilova, E., Kamada, T., & Zoutman, F. T. (2015, January 19). Is legal pot crippling Mexican drug trafficking organizations? The effect of medical marijuana laws on US crime. https://openaccess.nhh.no/nhh-xmlui/handle/11250/274521</ref>.

Increasing drug law enforcement leads to higher gun violence and high homicide rates, and the disruption of drug markets increases violence without decreasing drug supply<ref>Werb, D., Rowell, G., Guyatt, G., Kerr, T., Montaner, J., & Wood, E. (2011). Effect of drug law enforcement on drug market violence: A systematic review. International Journal of Drug Policy, 22(2), 87–94. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2011.02.002</ref>.

### Effect on Drug Use

**Somewhat positive effect**

The legalization of marijuana does not result in increased adolescent marijuana usage<ref>Choo, E. K., Benz, M., Zaller, N., Warren, O., Rising, K. L., & McConnell, K. J. (2014). The impact of state medical marijuana legislation on adolescent marijuana use. Journal of Adolescent Health, 55(2), 160–166. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.02.018</ref><ref>Sci-Hub | Medical Marijuana Laws and Teen Marijuana Use | 10.1093/Aler/AHV002. (n.d.). https://sci-hub.usualwant.com/10.1093/aler/ahv002</ref>, although it may slightly increase general marijuana usage<ref>Zellers, S. M., Ross, J. M., Saunders, G. R. B., Ellingson, J. M., Anderson, J. E., Corley, R. P., Iacono, W., Hewitt, J. K., Hopfer, C. J., McGue, M. K., & Vrieze, S. (2022). Impacts of recreational cannabis legalization on cannabis use: a longitudinal discordant twin study. Addiction, 118(1), 110–118. https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16016</ref>.

### Supervised Injection Sites

<span style="background-color:orange">Look into BC experience</span>

**Based**

Supervised injection sites reduce overdose mortality, reduce ambulance calls for treating overdoses, and decrease HIV infections, without increasing drug injection, trafficking, or crime in the surrounding environments<ref>Potier, C., Laprévote, V., Dubois-Arber, F., Cottencin, O., & Rolland, B. (2014). Supervised injection services: What has been demonstrated? A systematic literature review. Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 145, 48–68. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.10.012</ref><ref>Ng, J., Sutherland, C., & Kolber, M. R. (2017, November 1). Does evidence support supervised injection sites? PubMed Central (PMC). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5685449/</ref>. Decreased needle sharing and better health services at safe injection sites resulted in Vancouver's supervised injection facility saving more than $20 million and 1070 life years gained<ref>Bayoumi, A. M., & Zaric, G. S. (2008). The cost-effectiveness of Vancouver’s supervised injection facility. Canadian Medical Association Journal, 179(11), 1143–1151. https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.080808</ref>.

## Guns

### Homicide

**Moar guns = moar homicides**

In high-income countries with more firearms, both men and women are at higher risk of homicide, particularly firearm homicide<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/td3g80.pdf</ref>.

The US is among high-income countries a serious outlier when it comes to homicide, mostly due to their massive firearm homicide rates<ref>https://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1147&context=nursing_fac</ref>.

The presence of firearms increases aggression in people<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1088868317725419</ref>.

A disproportionately high number of 5-14 year olds die from homicide, suicide, and unintentional firearm deaths in states and regions where guns are more prevalent<ref>https://moscow.sci-hub.st/5262/a4a65f985a1236228760a36cbdc9d757/miller2002.pdf</ref><ref>https://files.catbox.moe/y36ppa.pdf</ref>.

In the US, higher levels of firearm ownership are associated with higher levels of firearm assault, firearm robbery, firearm homicides, and overall homicide<ref>http://ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(15)00072-0/pdf</ref>.

Across developed countries, where guns are more available there are more homicides<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11130511/</ref>.

### Suicide

**Moar guns = Moar suicides**

Homes in the US with and without firearms have no differences in mental health, substance dependence, abuse, suicidal ideation, and suicide planning. Having made a suicide attempt however is more common in households with firearms<ref>https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/15/3/183.short</ref>.

There is an association between gun ownership and overall risk of suicide, with the risk highest immediately after the purchase of a handgun. This suggests that some firearms are specifically used for the purpose of committing suicide<ref>https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10881/chapter/9</ref>.

Changes in a household's gun ownership over time are associated with significant changes in suicide<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563517/pdf/178.pdf</ref>.

### Economic Cost

**Guns have health costs**

Firearm injuries in the US have an economic cost between hundreds of millions per year to tens of billions per year<ref>https://www.childrenssafetynetwork.org/sites/default/files/TheCostofGunViolence.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039606014000609</ref><ref>https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2017.303684</ref>.

### General Strictness

**Gun control reduces deaths**

Stand-your-ground laws are at least in some contexts associated with increases in violence<ref>https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2020.306101</ref>.

A higher number of firearm laws in a state are associated with a lower rate of firearm fatalities in the state, overall, and for suicides and homicides individually<ref>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1661390</ref><ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5885268/</ref>.

Makarios & Pratt (2008) did a meta-analysis and found that in the US, most gun policies are unrelated to gun violence, including gun buybacks, enhanced prison terms, waiting periods/background checks, weapons bans, and safe storage laws. The only gun law that had marginal effects was bans on the sale of firearms<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0011128708321321?journalCode=cadc</ref>.

According to a RAND corporation systematic review, in the US in general, stricter gun control results in lower gun crime<ref>https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis.html</ref>.

Across countries, analysis indicates that stricter gun control entails a strong negative effect on overall homicide and suicide rates<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329840934_Does_regulation_matter_A_cross-national_analysis_of_the_impact_of_gun_policies_on_homicide_and_suicide_rates</ref>.

The strongest evidence is consistent with the claim that the Australian 1996 National Firearms Agreement caused reductions in firearm suicides, mass shootings, and female homicide victimization, although there is still evidence that raises questions<ref>https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/essays/1996-national-firearms-agreement.html</ref>.

Research from 130 studies in 10 different countries suggests that in some countries the simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple firearms restrictions is associated with reductions in firearms deaths, as well as background check and safer storage laws<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26905895/</ref>.

## Police General

There is considerable evidence in favor of the idea that crime is responsive to police, although the evidence on whether crime is responsive to the severity of criminal sanctions is less clear<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20141147</ref>. This has been demonstrated with research looking into a large exogenous change in the police force size following a terrorist attack which led to a large generalized deterrent effect of the police on crime<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282804322970733</ref>.

Depending on the study and type of crime, research suggests that the police-crime elasticity is anywhere from -0.1 to -1<ref>https://eml.berkeley.edu/~jmccrary/chalfin_mccrary2018.pdf</ref>. The violent crime elasticity appears to be -0.35 while the property crime elasticity is around -0.17. They are also -0.67 for murder, -0.56 for robbery, -0.34 for motor theft and -0.23 for burglary<ref>https://eml.berkeley.edu/~jmccrary/chalfin_mccrary2018.pdf</ref>.

The marginal social value of an additional dollar spent on police as a function of reduced crime has been estimated to be about $1.60, suggesting that cities may if anything be engaging in underpolicing<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18815/w18815.pdf</ref>. Another analysis estimated the benefit per dollar to be $1.63 in reduced victim costs<ref>https://eml.berkeley.edu/~jmccrary/chalfin_mccrary2018.pdf</ref>.

**“Hot spots”** policing research has produced the strongest evidence of police effectiveness available, showing that these programs overwhelmingly show significant crime reduction benefits<ref>https://legal-forum.uchicago.edu/print-archive/does-hot-spots-policing-inevitably-lead-unfair-and-abusive-police-practices-or-can-we</ref><ref>https://eml.berkeley.edu/~jmccrary/chalfin_mccrary2018.pdf</ref>. Furthermore, hot spots policing does not merely lead to crime displacement, but also has crime control benefits that diffuse into the areas immediately surrounding the targeted locations<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37133274/</ref>. When police use policing models such as increased police patrol or problem-oriented policing at crime hot spots, there is little evidence that the residents at those places are affected negatively in terms of fear of crime, perceptions of the police, or police legitimacy<ref>https://legal-forum.uchicago.edu/print-archive/does-hot-spots-policing-inevitably-lead-unfair-and-abusive-police-practices-or-can-we</ref>.

**Stop-and-frisk** was a police practice under which officers stopped and searched citizens, allegedly without reasonable suspicion required for such interventions<ref>https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/fact-sheet-stop-and-frisks-effect-crime-new-york-city</ref>. Research suggests that stop-and-frisk had negligible effects on all forms of crime from major felonies to misdemeanors<ref>https://econ.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/nathaniel_barlow_thesis.pdf</ref>. In New York, stop-and-frisk was unrelated to murders<ref>https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/fact-sheet-stop-and-frisks-effect-crime-new-york-city</ref>.

**Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV)** cameras have shown mixed effects on crime depending on the context<ref>https://popcenter.asu.edu/sites/default/files/Responses/video_surveillance/PDFs/Welsh%26Farrington_2002.pdf</ref>. A meta-analysis found that CCTV caused a modest (16 percent) decrease in crime in experimental areas compared to control areas, largely driven by the effectiveness of the schemes in car parks which caused a 51 percent decrease in crime<ref>https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/public-area-cctv-and-crime-prevention-update-systematic-review-and</ref>. Another review found a four percent crime reduction across studies<ref>https://popcenter.asu.edu/sites/g/files/litvpz3631/files/Responses/video_surveillance/PDFs/Welsh&Farrington_2002.pdf</ref>.

An experiment found that **routine preventative patrol** had no effect on the level of crime in an area. There was also no significant impact on the public’s feeling of security<ref>https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/42537NCJRS.pdf</ref>.

## Body-Worn Cameras

A systematic review and meta-analysis found that body-worn cameras showed no consistent or statistically significant effects in general. Research does not necessarily support notions that police body-worn cameras improve officer safety, increase evidence quality, reduce civilian complaints, or reduce agency liability<ref>https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/research-body-worn-cameras-and-law-enforcement</ref>. However, the context matters significantly. When officers have the discretion to turn cameras on and off during their shift, some evidence suggests that officers’ use of force increased, while when they leave the camera rolling for the entire shift, use of force decreased<ref>https://www.rand.org/news/press/2016/05/17.html</ref>. Another meta-analysis found a 9.6% decrease in police use of force from wearing body-worn cameras. It also found a 16.9% reduction in complaints against police<ref>https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/attachments/fa10fa8358f9a374192f2360e0cf620dd4fcb523/store/5959e869f443a4b4feb02bb33edcc63e12308bcb279b0b3d08d673c23a27/Williams+et+al_Body-Worn+Cameras_03_25.pdf</ref>. Some evidence also suggests that body-worn cameras reduce fear of the police from both black and non-black individuals<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356235878_Body-worn_cameras_lawful_police_stops_and_NYPD_officer_compliance_A_cluster_randomized_controlled_trial</ref>. Due to the second aforementioned meta-analysis finding benefits from body-worn cameras, they found a cost-benefit ratio of body-worn cameras of 4.95<ref>https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/attachments/fa10fa8358f9a374192f2360e0cf620dd4fcb523/store/5959e869f443a4b4feb02bb33edcc63e12308bcb279b0b3d08d673c23a27/Williams+et+al_Body-Worn+Cameras_03_25.pdf</ref>.

## Welfare Checks

Welfare checks when done generally do not involve suspected crime, but rather mental health, substance use, or medical crises. In most cases, police are the default first responders to welfare checks. There are many concerns with police doing welfare checks, including that they can make individuals resistant to treatment by disrupting treatment plans or negatively impacting trust between doctors, therapists and their patients. Knowing that police will respond to their calls may make family and friends less willing to call for welfare checks. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that sending the police to conduct welfare checks is effective in reducing harmful outcomes such as preventing suicide<ref>https://www.safetyreimagined.org/papers/welfare-checks</ref>.

Police are rarely trained to address the human, medical or social conditions that prompt welfare checks, and in some cases by entering a private space without warning they can precipitate violent confrontation, injury or death. Between 2019 and 2021, there were at least 178 instances in which officers shot and killed an individual they were called upon to assist<ref>https://www.safetyreimagined.org/papers/welfare-checks</ref>.

One way to improve police responses to welfare checks, especially when it’s necessary in cases which involve weapons or threats of violence, is to offer Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training<ref>https://www.safetyreimagined.org/papers/welfare-checks</ref>. Co-response which involves pairing police with mental health clinicians may have improved outcomes compared to police-only models<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35103364/</ref>. Some responses to welfare checks may not require any police intervention at all. A 2020 review of 911 calls in 8 major cities found that up to 68% of calls could be handled without sending an armed officer<ref>https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/07/25/police-mental-health-alternative-911</ref>.
