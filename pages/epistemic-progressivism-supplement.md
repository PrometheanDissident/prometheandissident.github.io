## Sociologist's Fallacy

The sociologist's fallacy refers to a type of bad control problem whereby it is assumed that because an environmental variable is related to a phenotypic characteristic that the environmental variable causes the characteristic, when the opposite could also be the case<ref>https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/2018/12/sociologists-fallacy-origins-of-the-term/</ref>. A common example of this is the assumption that intelligence is caused by socioeconomics because income is correlated with intelligence, when it could be the case that those with high intelligence tend to be wealthier and pass their genes down to their offspring who now have both a genetically high IQ and a high parental socioeconomic status. In reality, there is most likely bidirectional causality at play in these types of relationships.

## Cthulhu's Razor

Cthulhu's Razor, a term I coined, is a reasoning heuristic utilized in response to the reality that there is rampant left-wing political bias within knowledge-producing institutions which undermines their ability to pursue truth. Cthulhu's Razor says that whatever social scientific claim is made by academia, the truth is more likely to be to the right of that claim than to the left of it. A more extreme version of this might be that the truth _is_ to the right of whatever social scientific claim academia makes. The terminology is inspired by Yarvin's philosophy, which includes the claim that _"Cthulhu may swim slowly. But he only swims left"_ <ref>https://stianchrister.medium.com/cthulhu-swims-left-why-america-just-keeps-getting-more-woke-16ac4e36b4d7</ref>. While I have critiques of neo-reactionary thought, it nonetheless offers an effective linguistic framework through which to view political change which is still useful.

#### Moralistic Fallacy

The moralistic fallacy refers to the reverse of the relationship between truth and ethics, where instead of a normative claim being derived from a descriptive claim in an argument, a descriptive claim is derived from a normative claim. This form of reasoning is very common within ideological frameworks, which take a set of values they have and try to project them onto the world.
