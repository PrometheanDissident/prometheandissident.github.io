## Sociologist's Fallacy

The sociologist's fallacy refers to a type of bad control problem whereby it is assumed that because an environmental variable is related to a phenotypic characteristic that the environmental variable causes the characteristic, when the opposite could also be the case<ref>https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/2018/12/sociologists-fallacy-origins-of-the-term/</ref>. A common example of this is the assumption that intelligence is caused by socioeconomics because income is correlated with intelligence, when it could be the case that those with high intelligence tend to be wealthier and pass their genes down to their offspring who now have both a genetically high IQ and a high parental socioeconomic status. In reality, there is most likely bidirectional causality at play in these types of relationships.
