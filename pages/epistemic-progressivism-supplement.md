## Sociologist's Fallacy

The sociologist's fallacy refers to a type of bad control problem whereby it is assumed that because an environmental variable is related to a phenotypic characteristic that the environmental variable causes the characteristic, when the opposite could also be the case<ref>https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/2018/12/sociologists-fallacy-origins-of-the-term/</ref>. A common example of this is the assumption that intelligence is caused by socioeconomics because income is correlated with intelligence, when it could be the case that those with high intelligence tend to be wealthier and pass their genes down to their offspring who now have both a genetically high IQ and a high parental socioeconomic status. In reality, there is most likely bidirectional causality at play in these types of relationships.

## Social Constructions

All categories are social constructs, as they are linguistic tools used to communicate certain ideas with others. Ultimately, these are created by people, and so thus need to be judged not on whether they adhere perfectly to some idealized form independent of us, but whether they serve us value as we use them in our day-to-day lives<ref>https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/</ref>. Therefore, when definitions are being debated between two individuals, the two arguments often invoked are either an appeal to its common usage (appeal to external utility via popularity and inter-conversational coherence) or an appeal to its internal utility within the conversation, that it's more useful to define terms in this manner.

Because definitions are not forms found outside of people, it should not be expected that definitions are 100 percent coherent all the time. Given a definition of a chair, the definition will at some point either not satify objects that we would still refer to as chairs, or satisfy objects that we would not refer to as chairs. While definitions should not be expected to be completely coherent, they should still be relatively coherent so that they have value within communications between people. Exceptions to the rule can exist, but that doesn't mean that rules don't exist or aren't useful. Discussions about social constructs have been misunderstood and abused by many, especially in debates about racial or gender categories. But with this understanding, it becomes clear that it is possible to have definitions of ideas that do not work 100 percent of the time without reverting into a type of linguistic nihilism.

## Cthulhu's Razor

Cthulhu's Razor, a term I coined, is a reasoning heuristic utilized in response to the reality that there is rampant left-wing political bias within knowledge-producing institutions which undermines their ability to pursue truth. Cthulhu's Razor says that whatever social scientific claim is made by academia, the truth is more likely to be to the right of that claim than to the left of it. A more extreme version of this might be that the truth _is_ to the right of whatever social scientific claim academia makes. The terminology is inspired by Yarvin's philosophy, which includes the claim that _"Cthulhu may swim slowly. But he only swims left"_ <ref>https://stianchrister.medium.com/cthulhu-swims-left-why-america-just-keeps-getting-more-woke-16ac4e36b4d7</ref>. While I have critiques of neo-reactionary thought, it nonetheless offers an effective linguistic framework through which to view political change which is still useful.

## A Biorealist Account of Ethics

Ethics is something which has been extensively debated by philosophers for millennia. While interesting insights have been garnered from many of these debates, they primarily suffer from the error of attempting to develop systems of morality independently of people's underlying preferences. Ultimately, without any correspondence with people's preferences, any system of ethics fails to work properly because it cannot answer the question of why people should adhere to it. Rather than molding our actions to abstract and alien systems like utilitarianism or deontology, any system of ethics, to the degree that it would be useful to have, must be an expression and understanding of humanity's underlying preferences.

The goal of ethics must therefore be to examine what people's underlying preferences are, which requires us to examine humanity from an evolutionary or biological perspective. Ultimately then, any system of ethics must be coherent with the individual drives of people to survive and pass on their genome to the future. Humanity evolved to cooperate with one another to a significantly greater degree than most other mammals, but we also have our own interests independently of the interests of others, and cannot be seen as purely existing for others like collonies of eusocial insects do. The degree to which we have a sense of obligation varies depending on the person, existing first and foremost with the self, then gradually less with those of lower levels of genetic and/or relational proximity. Recognizing this allows us to understand why ethical systems like utilitarianism ultimately fail, and also helps to explain a lot of behaviors that people already engage in today.

This does not mean that biology completely determine's people's ethics or how we should view it, but its foundation must be biological in nature, as otherwise there is no reason to care about it or adhere to it. It would be like putting a circle in a square peg, it wouldn't fit.

### The Relationship Between Truth and Ethics

Given that the way humanity acts evolutionarily ultimately derives from attempts to optimize for particular biological outcomes, this can be seen as a kind of consequentialism by which we must search for the ways in which these outcomes can actually be optimized for. This requires an understanding of society and humanity, which will be able to better ascertain parrticular questions about morality. While much of this is abstract, this principle can and must be extended even to more concrete debates such as policy. The effects of particular political policies, while not always sufficient to ascertain what set of policies is best, is essential towards answering that question. Thus, the pursuit of truth must be emphasized as a crucial goal by individuals and society itself.

#### Moralistic Fallacy

The moralistic fallacy refers to the reverse of the relationship between truth and ethics, where instead of a normative claim being derived from a descriptive claim in an argument, a descriptive claim is derived from a normative claim. This form of reasoning is very common within ideological frameworks, which take a set of values they have and try to project them onto the world.
