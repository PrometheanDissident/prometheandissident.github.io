## On Biological Determinism

Biological determinism refers to an approach taken to studying humanity or other living organisms whereby behavioral traits are understood to be a product of genetic causes as opposed to environmental causes. Biological determinism, also oftentimes referred to as "biorealism", is very commonly used when discussing animal behavior, but it becomes more controversial when discussing human behavior. This is in part because of the factual landscape at play. Humans are known to be "neotenous" relative to other primates and animals<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2659716/</ref>, which among other things means that humans have much more "plastic" behavior. Nonetheless, humans are still biological animals, and environmental effects on human's behavior always have to interact with us as a mediator in order to have any actual effect on behavior. Because of this, while a pure biorealist analysis of humans would leave out a lot of important details, it is a crucial tool to better help understand us as a species.

The most important way that the effect of genes on behavioral or other traits is measured is through heritability. Heritability measures the proportion of the variance of a trait in a population that is explainable by variation in genes within that population. It is generally measured using twin studies, where monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins are compared in how different the twins are in their behavior relative to the other twin pair. This allows researchers to get a rough estimate for how genes affect the variance in behavior within a population. Research suggests that across a large number of traits analyzed, there was a mean 49% heritability of the traits among populations<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3285</ref>, meaning that a biorealist analysis of humanity can essentially explain half the variance in traits. It is hence indispensable as a tool. This is not limited to physical traits, but also behavioral traits. As the "First Law of Behavior Genetics" states, all human traits are at least partially heritable<ref>https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/the-first-law-of-behavior-genetics</ref>. One of the most replicated findings from behavioral genetics in fact is the finding that all psychological traits show significant and substantial genetic influence<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691615617439</ref>.

Heritability isn't perfect. As Moore & Shenk (2016) points out, there are several limitations to the notion of heritability<ref>https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.1400</ref>:

- First, heritability looks at the proportion of population variance in a trait that can be explained by population differences in genetics. This means that heritability estimates can be very different for the same trait depending on the population examined. For example, in the case of a population with very little environmental variation, you will have a significantly higher heritability estimate for a trait compared with a population with very high environmental variation.
- Second, given that all traits are filtered through genetics, it is impossible to actually separate out genetic from environmental effects. Genes turn on and respond in various ways depending on the environment, so the strict separation between genetic and environmental influences is highly dubious.
- Third, twin studies which are the hallmark of heritability estimates assume that identical twins have no more similar environments than fraternal twins (Equal environments assumption), and thus attribute all differences between groups to genetics. However, identical twins are exposed to demonstrably similar environments than are fraternal twins, starting in the womb. Identical twins often share a placenta while fraternal twins always have two separate placentas. Identical twins that share a placenta have more similar IQs and personalities than identical twins who do not share a placenta. This effect however appears to be small and only limited to a few phenotypes<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-015-9745-3</ref>. More significantly, it is likely that identical twins will be treated in social interactions more similarly than fraternal twins, increasing the similarity of their environments further. This has been shown to undermine research finding a strong heritability for schizophrenia, as identical twins have a smaller differences in their level of bullying, sexual abuse, physical maltreatment, emotional neglect and abuse, and general trauma compared to fraternal twins<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25972816/</ref>. Only some of those traits could be reasonably suggested to be genetic. This is consistent with research suggesting that the equal environments assumption is not strictly valid for most outcomes, with a likely modest bias<ref>https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1080/19485565.1968.9987750</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.10.004</ref>.

Of course, none of these limitations are fatal for heritability estimates. The notion that heritability is necessarily contingent on the type and variation in environment that a population is exposed to doesn't change the validity that it can have in explaining variation in outcomes within the context of those environmental parameters. It just limits its usefulness for examining how genes affect traits in populations with a vastly different environment. Additionally, even with all traits being filtered through a complex mix of genes and environment, this can just as easily be used to argue that genes affect traits more than most imagine they do, not less (see [Sociologist's Fallacy](https://prometheandissident.github.io/epistemic-progressivism-supplement/#sociologist%E2%80%99s-fallacy)). Another well-replicated finding from behavioral genetics is that most associations between environmental measures and psychological traits are significantly mediated genetically<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691615617439</ref>. Finally, even if the equal environments assumption can be undermined in certain circumstances, it has to be demonstrated that it is violated in a particular circumstance in a way that would meaningfully affect the trait in question. And even then, research suggests the actual effects are modest on final heritability estimates, so this doesn't significantly affect the validity of heritability.

Biological determinism isn't the end-all-be-all of human analysis, but it is a crucial part which has been unfairly stigmatized in much of modern discourse.

## On Intelligence

Intelligence refers to the ability to exercise one's mental faculties in effective ways. Researchers have been trying to measure intelligence for over a century through various forms of intelligence quotient (IQ) tests. These can test a range of abilities, from visuospatial abilities, to pattern recognition, to working memory, to verbal ability. IQ tests, despite being imperfect, are some of the most reliable and valid instruments in all of psychological science<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20170408134031/https://aeon.co/ideas/how-clever-is-it-to-dismiss-iq-tests</ref>. No measure has been more aggressively attacked and withstood more criticism than IQ, so the fact that it is still extensively utilized in many circles is a testament to its robustness. It is furthermore extremely important as it measures the capacity of one's mental faculties, perhaps the most significant trait that defines humanity as distinct from other species and one of the most important factors in determining lifetime success.

The IQ test originated from the observation that abilities in one domain positively correlated with abilities in another domain, such as in various subjects in school whose content was generally unrelated. This was transformed into the idea that there was a general factor of intelligence, or "g factor", which has since become a common topic of study among psychologists. This g factor is not only limited to humans. Rats display a general factor of intelligence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8510832/</ref>, as well as dogs<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016028961630023X</ref>. Furthermore, the g factor also exists amongst chimpanzees, and the more g-loaded cognitive abilities had more genetic variance and phenotypic variance and were more heritable, suggesting it is associated with high interspecies variance and evolves rapidly<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.04.002</ref>.

This general intelligence factor is highly heritable in humans<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15651931/</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0160289614000099</ref>, and can predict academic performance, career potential, creativity, and job performance<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.86.1.148</ref>. Furthermore, there is expert consensus that g is an important non-trivial predictor or determinant of important real world outcomes, and that g tests are valid and generally do not have racial bias<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2008.03.007</ref>. The g factor has been shown to also exist in international cognitive ability comparisons, suggesting it is a universal phenomenon<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.634</ref><ref>https://emilkirkegaard.dk//en/wp-content/uploads/The-g-factor-of-international-cognitive-ability-comparisons-the-homogeneity-of-results-in-PISA-TIMSS-PIRLS-and-IQ-tests-across-nations.pdf</ref><ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-01683-001.pdf</ref>.

The fact that there is a general factor of intelligence undermines attempts by many, often motivated by ideology or personal preference, to come up with alternative views of intelligence which leave open the possibility of multiple types of intelligence. Highly diverse tests of purely cognitive abilities are strongly g-loaded, suggesting that multiple intelligences do not exist<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2006.02.004</ref>. Attempts to measure different types of intelligence generally fall into the problem of ignoring the general intelligence factor. For example, many have tried to construct an idea of emotional intelligence and assert that such a trait can be studied independently of general intelligence. However, research similarly shows that emotional intelligence can be reduced to g, personality trait agreeableness, and sex<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2003.11.014</ref>.

It is important to note that IQ in and of itself isn't important. Psychologists do not care about a person's IQ score per se. Rather, they use that score to measure some trait, in this case intelligence, and the IQ measure is only good insofar as it can effectively measure that trait. The degree to which a test result correlates to the actual general factor of intelligence the test is intended to measure refers to the "g loading" of the test. Many critiques of intelligence testing can be addressed by simply understanding this fact. A simple example of this concerns the validity of IQ testing across multiple runs. It is true that a person can get a high IQ score by simply studying to an IQ test in a way which can game the IQ test. However, IQ test-retest score gains are correlated with g loadings at -1, meaning that score gains are not g-loaded at all<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2006.07.006</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2018.10.004</ref>. Once a person starts gaming the test, it ceases to have any validity towards its intended purpose, which is to measure general mental ability. Just because it can be gamed into telling a person that they're smarter than they actually are doesn't mean that it can't be useful for measuring the underlying general ability of those who are not gaming the test.

As another example, many critique IQ testing and often standardized tests more generally by suggesting that some people are simply not good at being tested. These types of people are often said to be unable to "peform under pressure", and get high levels of anxiety before taking standardized tests. This is then theorized to lead to test results underestimating the actual ability of such individuals. However, research shows that test anxiety does not induce measurement bias in aptitude and cognitive ability test scores<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2007.11.003</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.08.007</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2016.06.030</ref>. Rather, test anxiety is most closely related to psychometric g<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2013.11.003</ref>. Test anxiety appears to, on the net, simply be a function of those with it not actually being that smart, whether it be due to their anxiety generally causing underperformance in their lives or due to their anxiety simply being a function of low underlying cognitive ability. Since test anxiety has been shown to be unimportant in IQ testing, I am therefore skeptical of this as a meaningful critique of standardized testing in general.

For a final example, it has been shown through research that adoption can raise a person's IQ. Adopted siblings or peers have higher IQ scores than their nonadopted siblings or peers who stayed behind<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15740423/</ref>. However, these effects are not g-loaded, meaning that whatever way adoption raises the IQ of children has essentially no effect on their actual underlying cognitive ability<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886914005248</ref>.

Intelligence is highly heritable. A meta-analysis of studies amounting to a total of 280 pairs of identical twins reared apart implies a heritability of IQ of 0.83, or a 95% confidence interval of 0.74-0.91<ref>https://www.sebjenseb.net/p/we-now-have-280-pairs-of-identical?utm_source=publication-search</ref>. There are a very high number of genetic loci which have been found to be associated with intelligence<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3869</ref><ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04362-x?ref=iqpredictionnews</ref><ref>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.024554v3.full.pdf</ref>. High intelligence is also familial, heritable, and caused by the same genetic and environmental factors responsible for the normal distribution of intelligence<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/xd769q.pdf</ref>. Additionally, intellectual disability is heritable at 51%<ref>https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13560</ref>. Similarly, educational attainment is reasonably heritable<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69526-6</ref><ref>https://files.catbox.moe/3t8uvr.pdf</ref>.

One of the ways that intelligence is genetic is through the underlying size of human's brains. It is well-known that brain size relative to the size of an animal's body can influence their intelligence compared to other species. But this also works within humans. In humans, brain size is positively associated with g<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32076418/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25855618/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31473014/</ref>. This is of genetic origin as whole-brain gray and white matter is highly heritable<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32286890/</ref>, and there is a genetic correlation between intracranial volume and years of education<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32286899/</ref>, as well as intelligence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15922990/</ref>. Brain morphology more broadly appears to affect human intelligence as well. Human intelligence can be predicted with some accuracy using neuroimaging techniques<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14749147/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25546071/</ref>.

Interestingly, the heritability of IQ increases with age, being lower than 0.8 in younger individuals, a phenomenon known as the "Wilson effect"<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-meta-analysis-of-11000-pairs-of-twins-shows-that-the-heritability-of-intelligence_fig1_265690996</ref>. This contradicts notions that individuals begin as blank slates who can be molded into anything if someone starts trying to mold them at a young age. While intelligence is more environmentally malleable at a younger age, as the person ages the genes eventually take over until by the time they're an adult their intelligence will largely reflect their genetic makeup.

A high heritability of intelligence doesn't mean that there can never be environmental factors which has a significant effect on a person's intelligence. As discussed in the section [On Biological Determinism](https://prometheandissident.github.io/psychology/#on-biological-determinism), heritability is always measures environmental variance relative to genetic variance in a population. If environmental variance is low, then heritability can be high even if an environmental change can have a massive effect on said trait. An example of an environmental effect on intelligence which appears to be large is lead exposure. Research shows that there is an inverse relationship between blood lead concentration and IQ and reading test scores<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1257652/</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22558/w22558.pdf</ref>. These effects are g loaded<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.09.005</ref>.

### The Utility of IQ Testing

Intelligence testing is an uncomfortable thing to talk about among many individuals simply because it reduces ambiguity concerning how smart one person is relative to another. Most people want to have a high image of themselves, and so they will want to avoid anything which might have to question the notion that they might be as smart as they think they are. While women tend to be pretty good about not rating themselves too higly, as according to one study they rated their IQ on average as just under 101, slightly above the expected average of 100 for the sample, men rate themselves on average as much higher than they actually are more likely, assessing their IQ on average to be just under 107<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339187510_Correlates_of_Self-Estimated_Intelligence</ref>. Self-assessed intelligence, while not completely unrelated to a person's actual intelligence, only correlates at around 0.30 with actual intelligence, suggesting that people's judgments tend to be biased upwards and also show a lot of error<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11433033/</ref>.

I do think that while intelligence is extremely important to study and pay attention to on a societal level, the average person doesn't need to know their IQ. In general, a person's intelligence will be strongly implied by their accomplishments and will be picked up on by peers to a surprisingly accurate degree. A 2003 study had participants watch one-minute videos of individuals in discussions and then had them rate how intelligence they thought the individuals in the videos were. The correlation between the strangers assessments of their intelligence and their actual intelligence was .37 - substantially higher than the aforementioned correlation between self-rated intelligence and actual intelligence testing results<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-6494.7103008?sid=nlm%3Apubmed</ref>! With extended interaction, this correlation is almost certainly going to go up, meaning that an actual IQ test will become superfluous in making competence assessments in interpersonal interactions. There may be some value in having cognitive ability testing for jobs, but even then the individual doing the test doesn't need to be aware of their own score.

The only cases where I think it is oftentimes important for an individual to have their IQ tested and for them to know their score is in extreme cases, either when the person appears to be extremely intelligent or when the person appears to be extremely unintelligent, particularly in educational settings. In these cases, there is value in knowing that an individual might need extra support, either with acceleration or enrichment in the case of a 130+ IQ individual, or with extra learning supports in the case of a sub-70 IQ individual.

### The Predictive Validity of Intelligence

Predictive validity in the context of intelligence means that when you know and individual or group's IQ score, you can accurately predict other outcomes based on that knowledge. It does not necessarily say anything about the causality of the relationship. Causality however is still important to ascertain, but it is difficult to do so. The main problem is because of the challenge associated with the aforementioned [Sociologist's Fallacy](https://prometheandissident.github.io/epistemic-progressivism-supplement/#sociologist%E2%80%99s-fallacy). For example, when examining the link between IQ and income, is it that high IQ causes income, or is it that income causes a high IQ? This becomes especially important when we are bringing a third variable into the analysis such as crime. When looking at the link between IQ and crime, it might be that income causes a higher IQ and higher crime, and so a potential link between IQ and crime is confounded by income. Thus, in this case it would be important to control for income. However, if IQ is what causes income and crime, then controlling for income could lead to an underestimate of the effect of IQ on crime, assuming that income is a channel through which IQ causes crime.

Given that IQ appears to be heritable at 0.8 (see [On Intelligence](https://prometheandissident.github.io/psychology/#on-intelligence)), this suggests that the variance between individuals in IQ is primarily due to variance in genes as opposed to environment. This means that environment plays a small role in intelligence, and it is primarily innate factors which drive intelligence. Therefore, the causality likely in general runs from IQ to environment, not from environment to IQ, unless there is a good reason to think otherwise.

The number of individual traits that IQ can predict are substantial, and include crime, income, wealth, education and creativity:

- **Crime -** Research suggests that intelligence is correlated with crime, with most research suggesting independently of socio-economics status<ref>https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2123&context=jclc</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1996.tb01220.x</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886911000912</ref>. This predictive validity of IQ persists in cross-state comparisons<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886909005169</ref>. This relationship, however, is not perfectly linear. People who have very low intelligence have slightly lower criminality than people with fairly low intelligence, and people with very high intelligence have slightly higher criminality than people with fairly high intelligence<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016028961500077X</ref><ref>https://clcjbooks.rutgers.edu/books/criminal-genius-a-portrait-of-high-iq-offenders/</ref>. There is a small negative relationship between IQ and rearrest<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29954769/</ref>. Estimates of IQ across states and counties have shown to be negatively correlated with crime<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19529925/</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289613000190</ref>.
- **Individual Income/Wealth -** There is a relationship between an individual’s intelligence level and their future income. People with higher intelligence levels tend to have higher incomes<ref>https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=d6fdb1364dc3e73c44441ba55a15f1b9bc49265a</ref><ref>https://ifstudies.org/blog/can-intelligence-predict-income</ref>. Importantly, however, this relationship does not appear to translate perfectly in terms of total wealth. While intelligence predicts higher income, it has a quadratic relationship with financial distress<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289607000219</ref>. Therefore, it is not entirely clear how much net wealth is affected by intelligence. IQ is a better predictor of socioeconomic success than parental SES or grades<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11334871/</ref>. IQ and conscientiousness are also more important than SES for educational attainment<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11916378/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11058498/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29611892/</ref>. Maynard & Murnane (1979) looked at the impact of a negative income tax experiment and found that it increased the average reading achievement of children in grades 4 through 6, but not for older children<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25328893/</ref>. Similarly, Duncan et al. (2011) conducted a random monetary assignment experiment and found that an increase in annual income results in a substantial increase in young children's achievement<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28081903/</ref>. Financial stress can temporarily lower IQ<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32188746/</ref>. Childhood IQ is associated with class mobility in adulthood across all social classes<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32661290/</ref>. Polygenic scores have been identified that are associated with social mobility<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29049045/</ref>.
- **Educational Attainment -** Intelligence is a major predictor of school achievements, partially through more intelligent people having higher levels of motivation to succeed in school environments<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289615001269</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X18300691</ref>. Students attending selective schools tend to outperform their non-selective counterparts in national exams. However, there are substantial mean genetic differences between students of different school types on a polygenic score associated with higher education. After controlling for factors involved in pupil selection, there were no significant genetic differences between school types, and the variance in exam scores explained by school type dropped to less than 1%. This suggests that genetic and exam differences between school types are primarily due to heritable characteristics involved in pupil admission<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12578471/</ref>. Experiments suggest that the effects of interventions that raise IQ fade away following the intervention because children who receive the interventions lose their IQ advantage<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25281007/</ref>. Headstart gains are correlated at -0.8 with g loadings, suggesting that headstart gains are generally not on the g factor<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289614000932</ref>. Schooling gains are not g loaded<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31109385/</ref>.
- **SAT -** The SAT is strongly correlated with g<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00687.x</ref>. Coaching has a small but positive effect on SAT scores<ref>https://meridian.allenpress.com/her/article-abstract/53/1/1/31190/Evaluating-the-Effect-of-Coaching-on-SAT-Scores-A?redirectedFrom=fulltext</ref>.
- **Creativity -** There is a small and heterogeneous positive correlation between IQ and creativity<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30009212/</ref>.

Intelligence also appears to be associated with health outcomes. Higher intelligence is associated with a substantially lower risk of death, even after adjusting for childhood and adult socioeconomic status as well as education, although adult SES and education attenuate it substantially<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyq190</ref>. Research suggests that this effect is mostly genetic in origin<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyv112</ref>.

Finally, on a national level, IQ can also have a significant predictive effect on outcomes as well. National IQ is correlated with a variety of educational, cognitive, economic, political, demographic, sociological, geographic, and climate variables<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27866536/</ref>. National IQ is positively correlated with economic development, and is the best predictor of economic growth<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29328072/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30191806/</ref>. Education and cognitive ability appear to be more important as developmental factors for GDP than economic freedom. Education and intelligence are more relevant to economic welfare than vice versa, but economic welfare also predicts education and intelligence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28201577/</ref>. A 1 point increase in a nation's average IQ is associated with a persistent 0.11% annual increase in per-capita GDP<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00439.x</ref>. IQ is also associated with the production and exportation of more sophisticated/complex products<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289612001134</ref>. IQ is also a significant predictor of financial development<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.03.007</ref>.

## On Morality and Human Sociality

Another one of the most fundamental aspects of humanity is that we have ethics and exist as social creatures. While we are not purely collectivistic in the way that eusocial insects are, we still have much higher levels of community bonding than most species do. One of the most important things that we need to begin understanding is how morality and human social structures evolved over time, as it can help us better construct our societies today.

Morality or ethics can be understood as the codification of rules meant for individuals to exist within communities effectively. All ethical systems can only exist in the context of other humans who can be interacted with in particular ways, or in the context of other agents if you take a more moral circle expansionistic approach to ethics. Because ethics cannot exist outside of the context of human communities, it must be understood as something which evolved alongside human communities, and so the question emerges as to what led ethical systems, rudimentary or complex, to emerge.

But before that, the first question which must be answered is how human communities evolved. While many primates have communities, humans have uniquely large communities relative to other mammals. Part of this is due to cognitive barriers. Individuals can only cognitively have a certain number of connections with other individuals. It is impossible to have a connection with everyone in the world, simply because it becomes cognitively and also temporally impossible to understand and remember details about everyone as well as continously engage in reciprocal interaction however defined to maintain such connections. A rough estimate of the maximum number of friends the average person can have was arrived at by the anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who came up with the number 150, oftentimes referred to as "Dunbar's number". Dunbar’s number of 150 is based on the relative size of human’s neocortexes relative to other primates and extrapolating the social group size of those primates to humans indexed by neocortex size. This number has been replicated independently by analyzing the number of Christmas cards that individuals send out to others. Maximum network size as measured by the exchange of Christmas cards was 153.5 individuals, with a mean network size of 124.9 for those individuals explicitly contacted. This estimate is shockingly close to Dunbar's "back-of-the-envelope calculation", and strongly implies that there may be cognitive constraints on network size<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26189988/</ref>. Validating the notion that Dunbar's number is a function of cognitiver constraints, research suggests that the number of friends a person has reliably predicts grey matter density in areas of the brain implicated in social perception and associative memory, suggesting that brain structure heavily contributes to the way in which social cognition operates in humans<ref>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2011.1959</ref>.

The cognitive limitation that Dunbar's number implies exists even extends to online relationships, despite the fact that interaction with a person online is generally speaking much more accessible and so can happen with much greater efficiency. The size of online egocentric social networks, indexed as the number of Facebook friends, is similar to that of offline face-to-face networks, suggesting a cognitive constraint on the size of social networks that even communications advantages of online media are unable to overcome<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26909163/</ref>. In fact, an analysis of a dataset of twitter conversations involving 1.7 million individuals suggests that users can entertain a maximum of about 100-200 stable relationships<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022656</ref>, which while a large range, strongly puts Dunbar's number of 150 in the ballpark. In short, while none of this evidence points to where the causality arises, it strongly suggests that high human cognitive ability allowed larger and more sophisticated social networks to emerge in the species as it evolved.

Social groups emerged precisely because they were necessary for human survival. Human societies exist as they do today because of group members enforcing moral behaviors and social rules on each other. Social punishment ultimately shaped the group’s survival, which led to advantageous evolutionary strategies that foster conscience and altruism. Acts such as cheating, stealing or killing were dealt with systematically early in the dawn of Homo Sapiens through the use of shame, ostracism or other punitive actions, which has led to an adaptive genetic inheritance of “social self controls”. The biological advantage of imposing rules of behavior in the first place is that groups survive better than single individuals. This social selection is certainly not as strong as sexual selection or natural selection is, as countless people today violate social norms nonetheless. One possible reason is that it has not been around long enough<ref>https://dwz.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/114/2016/11/MoralBookReview.pdf</ref>.

### The Emergence of Morality in Social Groups

There are a number of different perspectives on morality which often aim to answer differing questions but also look at differing aspects of human psychology and social relations and what is required for communities to fluorish. According to the primatologist Frans de Waal, morality's defining traits which include empathy, reciprocity, reconciliation and consolation, can be seen in many animals, most particularly in primates. Empathy is an automatic response seen in human infants, dogs and apes. This most likely originates with parents' care but extends beyond parent-child relationships. Both chimps and capuchins will work with other members of their groups to reach a common goal even if there is no immediate reward. In order to preserve important relationships, chimps will engage in friendly reunions after a conflict, similar to the way a married couple or good friends might reconcile after a conflict. Consolation, defined as friendly contact and reassurance by an uninvolved third party after a conflict, is a behavior seen only in great apes and humans<ref>https://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/2007/April/April%2016/DeWaal.htm</ref>.

What is clear is that a lot of the fundamentals of human morality are universal, implying that the origins of morality are innate to some direct or indirect extent. Although the particulars have substantial cultural variation, a sense of fairness appears to be a human universal that has been shown to prevail in a wide variety of circumstances. Many highly cooperative nonhuman species also appear to have an aversion to inequity. The brown capuchin monkey responds negatively to unequal reward distribution in exchanges with a human experimenter. Monkeys refused to participate if they witnessed a conspecific obtain a more attractive reward for equal effort, an effect amplified if the partner received such a reward without any effort at all. This supports the notion of an early evolutionary origin of inequity aversion<ref>https://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/publications/articles/Brosnan_deWaal_2003.pdf</ref>.

Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory attempts to explain why despite vast differences across cultures, morality often has shared themes and similarities across populations by suggesting there are several innate psychological systems at the core of our “intuitive ethics”. The original framework identified five foundations that were strongly supported by evidence across various cultures<ref>https://moralfoundations.org/</ref>:
- Care: Comes from ability to feel and dislike pain of others, underlies virtues of kindness, gentleness and nurturance
- Fairness: Comes from reciprocal altruism, underlies virtues of justice and rights. 
- Loyalty: Active when people feel attached to coalitions, underlies patriotism and self-sacrifice for the group
- Authority: Deference to prestigious authority figures and respect for traditions
- Purity: Underlies idea that the body is a temple that can be desecrated by immoral activities and contaminants, underlies self-discipline, self-improvement, naturalness and spirituality

Fairness was later split into equality and proportionality, which suggests that there exists six foundations. Other foundations that Haidt suggests could exist but didn't include in his theory consist of liberty, honor and ownership<ref>https://moralfoundations.org/</ref>.

A significant portion of research examining human morality looks at game theory experiments, a subset of behavioral economics which examines how people interact with others in situations where they have payoffs which vary depending on the interactions between their strategies and the strategies of other players. For example, in the ultimatum game, a proposer decides how much of $10 to give a responder, and the responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer. If the responder accepts, the players split the money in the way the proposer suggested. If the responder rejects, neither player gets any money. This happens only once and the players know this<ref>https://fte.org/teachers/teacher-resources/lesson-plans/is-capitalism-good-for-the-poor-2/the-ultimatum-game-appendix-1/</ref>.

Game theory predicts that since both parties know the rejection of the offer results in neither receiving any money, the proposer will offer the smallest possible amount and the responder will always accept. However, in practice proposers generally offer more than the minimum and responders frequently reject low offers, choosing to receive nothing. The rejection of the selfishness axiom exists cross-culturally, as a study of 15 small indigenous societies on 4 continents found significant cultural group differences in behavior but none held to the selfishness axiom. Some economists try to model this by including “other-regarding” preferences, where players have an innate conception of fairness<ref>https://fte.org/teachers/teacher-resources/lesson-plans/is-capitalism-good-for-the-poor-2/the-ultimatum-game-appendix-1/</ref>.

In market economies, people’s concern for reputation modifies the predicted materially self-interested behavior that often fails to appear in ultimatum games. There is a correlation between more equal splits and markets which holds in both developed countries as well as indigenous subsistence economies. Thus, there is a positive relationship between market integration and offer size in the ultimatum game, which is the opposite of what many would expect who instead believe that markets make people selfish<ref>https://fte.org/teachers/teacher-resources/lesson-plans/is-capitalism-good-for-the-poor-2/the-ultimatum-game-appendix-1/</ref>.

So much of morality encompasses notions of fairness and reciprocity, but another significant aspect of morality is the reality of kinship. Many animals are willing to sacrifice something in order to preserve the life or well-being of their young, and the reason why this is the case is because this is in effect the parent preserving their own genes. Hamilton's Rule helps to explain when this type of altruistic behavior occurs. In general, animals will engage in altruistic behavior when the benefit as well as the kinship of the other animal exceeds the person cost<ref>https://www.britannica.com/science/Hamiltons-rule</ref>. This can extend to relationships based on genetic similarity that are not parent-child, such as extended family or even more beyond. A lot of human's senses of obligation towards one another consist of concentric circles of obligation which exist on the basis of genetic or relational proximity. Research corroborates this in the context of friendships. There exists layers of friend circles, where the emotionally closest circles are the smallest, and the least emotionally close circles are the largest<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301879177_Calling_Dunbar's_Numbers</ref><ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1634986/</ref>.

- There are two major aspects to human morality/sociality: reciprocity and familiarity

### Moral Development

If humans can be said to have established a system of morality that is more sophisticated than other primates, and many primates can be said to have a rudimentary form of morality not seen in other animals, it follows that there exists a dimension of "moral development" which species can be ranked accordingly on. But just as between-species comparisons can in theory be made on this dimension, within-species comparisons can also be. The late psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg aimed to measure moral development in humans. Kohlberg’s theory of moral development consists of six stages arranged sequentially in successive tiers of complexity. The first two are in level 1, the preconventional level; the next two are in level 2, the conventional level; and the last two are in level 3, the postconventional level<ref>https://www.britannica.com/science/Lawrence-Kohlbergs-stages-of-moral-development</ref>.

At the preconventional level, morality is externally controlled<ref>https://www.britannica.com/science/Lawrence-Kohlbergs-stages-of-moral-development</ref>.
- Stage 1: Punishment/obedience orientation - Behaviour is determined by consequences. The individual will obey in order to avoid punishment.
- Stage 2: Instrumental purpose orientation - Behaviour is determined again by consequences. The individual focuses on receiving rewards or satisfying personal needs.

At the conventional level, conformity to social rules remains important, but the emphasis shifts from self-interest to relationships with other people and social systems<ref>https://www.britannica.com/science/Lawrence-Kohlbergs-stages-of-moral-development</ref>.
- Stage 3: Good Boy/Nice Girl orientation - Behaviour is determined by social approval. The individual wants to maintain or win the affection and approval of others by being a “good person.”
- Stage 4: Law and order orientation - Social rules and laws determine behaviour. The individual now takes into consideration a larger perspective, that of societal laws. Moral decision making becomes more than consideration of close ties to others. The individual believes that rules and laws maintain social order that is worth preserving.

At the postconventional or principled level, the individual moves beyond the perspective of their own society, and defines morality in terms of abstract principles and values that apply to all situations and societies. The individual attempts to take the perspective of all individuals<ref>https://www.britannica.com/science/Lawrence-Kohlbergs-stages-of-moral-development</ref>.
- Stage 5: Social contract orientation - Individual rights determine behaviour. The individual views laws and rules as flexible tools for improving human purposes. That is, given the right situation, there are exceptions to rules. When laws are not consistent with individual rights and the interests of the majority, they do not bring about good for people and alternatives should be considered.
- Stage 6: Universal ethical principle orientation - According to Kohlberg, this is the highest stage of functioning. However, he claimed that some individuals will never reach this level. At this stage, the appropriate action is determined by one’s self-chosen ethical principles of conscience. These principles are abstract and universal in application. This type of reasoning involves taking the perspective of every person or group that could potentially be affected by the decision.

Data shows that older individuals tend to use higher stages of moral reasoning when compared with younger individuals, and there is “upward” progression in accordance with the theoretical order of stages. Studies have revealed that comprehension of the stages is cumulative (i.e. someone at stage 4 understands the lower stages but not necessarily the higher stages)<ref>https://www.britannica.com/science/Lawrence-Kohlbergs-stages-of-moral-development</ref>. This is consistent with Kohlberg's scheme of moral development being a valid means by which moral development can be ordinally measured.

It is important to understand that Kohlberg’s scheme should not be interpreted in terms of increasing degrees of moral maturity, but rather in terms of personality style and political preferences<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cui-bono/202506/do-liberals-protest-more-than-conservatives</ref>. The reason why can be best articulated by examining an alternative measure of moral judgment established by another researcher, which places an "ethics of personal conscience" (low scorers) on one end and "ethics of social responsibility" (high scorers) on another end<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0030095</ref>. The former would be generally put at a higher stage of moral development on Kohlberg's scale relative to the latter. Both have advantages and disadvantages. It should be clarified that a low or high score doesn't mean anything normatively, it's simply how the measure was set up and have nothing to do with judgments over what score is better than the other.

Persons whose moral appraisals are grounded on considerations which regularly transcend the dictates of law and custom may be unconventional, liberal, and progressive; however, they may also be capricious, undependable, and anticonforming. On the other hand, persons whose moral judgments are guided by rational and legal considerations are often thoughtful, considerate, and honest; yet, they may also be conventional and overconforming. They have a strong need for structure and order and tend to gravitate to positions where support of rules of conduct is viewed as positive behavior. Low scorers, on the other hand, often seem to delight in changing the "system." Thus, both high and low scorers on the test possess unique virtues and drawbacks, and an effective society undoubtedly requires both kinds of persons; that is, high scorers to provide stability and order, low scorers to provide the stimulus for evolution and change<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0030095</ref>.

The fact is that not everyone should have a stage 6 level of moral development, as that can risk leading to excessive rebellious orientation in the average person when it is ultimately not necessary. Some people should be rebellious, but in large-scale political contexts it should always be done with careful thought and consideration, something that the average person would not have.

### Implications for our own Moral Theorizing

- Discuss evolutionary mismatch in modern contexts which explains why ethical debates are so annoying so often

<span style="background-color:orange">Some elements of morality clearly evolved, but the specifics are unclear, which underlines the implications that ecopsych people take when using this to discuss moral philosophy. A small body of evidence suggests that normative cognition, the ability to grasp and apply norms, evolved. This provides weak evidence that moral cognition evolved. Some argue that if morality evolved then it is undermined in its legitimacy, but if normative cognition evolved in general then under that same logic other norms such as epistemic norms would then be equally undermined<ref>https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/MacheryMallonEvolutionMorality2010.pdf</ref>.</span>


### Social Isolation in the Modern Era

## Psychology of Belief

Beliefs generally speaking serve to different purposes, one individual and one collective. Beliefs have the individual purpose of allowing individuals to form accurate judgments about the world. But on the collective level, beliefs can also exist for the sake of social cohesion and to give people a sense of purpose. A lot of irrational beliefs that persist in the world come from collectivistic motivations for holding particular ideas, but they don't have to.

A lot of pop psychology discourse focuses itself on "cognitive biases", ways in which people's thinking can be irrational, and many of these biases such as the "bandwagon effect" or the "bystander effect" are functions of existing in a social world, and would thus have more collectivistically-oriented motivations behind them, many do not, such as the "availability heuristic". Psychologists have coined so many different biases that it can be difficult to piece together if or how they might relate to one another. Is it really that various evolutionary errors or shortcuts in the brain have led to dozens of different cognitive biases emerging which are all distinct from one another in terms of their cognitive origins, or are there general errors or shortcuts which can explain groups of biases, or perhaps even all of the observed biases we see?

Attempting to increase parsimony in the research on cognitive biases, psychologists Aileen Oeberst and Roland Imhoff propose that all biases stem from some underlying belief which is then reinfored through confirmation bias, the bias whereby individuals actively seek information which confirms their prior beliefs and actively avoid information which disconfirms their prior beliefs. They suggest that six "fundamental beliefs" can explain a wide number of the biases that are studied in psychology. They include the following<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916221148147</ref>:

1. "My experience is a reasonable reference."
2. "I make correct assessments of the world."
3. "I am good."
4. "My group is a reasonable reference."
5. "My group (members) is (are) good."
6. "People’s attributes (not context) shape outcomes."

There are certainly underlying evolutionary reasons why some or all of these fundamental beliefs might be so ubiquitous among people. For example, beliefs 4 and 5 might be direct or indirect products of behavioral patterns seen among people as a product of kin selection (see [The Emergence of Morality in Social Groups](https://prometheandissident.github.io/psychology/#the-emergence-of-morality-in-social-groups)). Such a framework, while rudimentary and will hopefully be expanded upon in the future, allows us to understand biases in a much more systematic way, as opposed to the scattershot pop psych way they are so often framed in mainstream discussions.

In general, beliefs aim to create models of the world which allow one to engage in the world in a way which maximizes their survival and reproductive chances. This generally means that beliefs are aiming to get an accurate understanding of the world, although not necessarily. In order for individuals to get an accurate understanding of the world, they must use epistemic tools and heuristics through which they can properly take in and interpret sense data. This can be done completely independently of a broader social structure, and by necessity will resemble the scientific method which has been developed and codified within particular social structures. Because scientific processes are arrived at by humans independently of being told of their existence, science can in some sense be argued to not actually be a social construct<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWZXuozoeFk</ref>.

In many cases, because of these epistemic processes, human judgment can actually be surprisingly accurate, even from those of average or below-average intelligence. In the biologist Francis Galton's famous study in 1907 where he had nearly 800 participants try to guess the weight of an ox, the participants' averaged guess was nearly identical to the actual weight of the ox<ref>https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/the-real-wisdom-of-the-crowds</ref>. 

Furthermore, in the abstract people are actually quite good at correcting their beliefs in the face of new evidence. For example, although there has been previous research suggesting that correcting misinformation may backfire, causing people to strengthen false misconceptions rather than reduce them, more recent research suggests that by and large citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their ideological commitments<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-018-9443-y</ref><ref>https://skepticalscience.com/docs/DebunkingHandbook2020.pdf</ref>. This doesn't generally speaking happen right away, simply because changing one's mind often brings active discomfort in people, but it does often happen in the long-run. A 2004 meta-analysis found that there is a sleeper effect, where a discounting piece of evidence is less persuasive immediately after exposure than it is later in time. The increase in persuasion is stronger when recipients of discounting cues have higher ability or motivation to think about the message<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3100161/</ref>.

However, the wisdom and self-corrective behaviors that humans can exhibit often require that people's judgments are independent of one another. If they are not independent, people can form irrational beliefs and stick with them even in the face of disconfirming evidence, as Kenneth Westhues notes happens with mobbing, a subject that will be discussed in more detail later<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/takeaways240723.html</ref>. The fact that abnormal psychology focuses on individual forms of irrational or dysfunctional behavior or contagions can be interpreted as an implicit acknowledgment of the fact that groups having these types of dynamics is in fact perfectly normal. Individuals are not irrational under this interpretation. Groups are.

When group dynamics are brought to the table, then other desires outside of direct truth generally become more prominent. People need a sense of purpose which requires interaction with a group, and people have a desire to conform and thrive within a group. This is why a lot of people get involved in particular causes, such as political ideologies or religions. Many ideologies or religions preach things that are obviously dysfunctional, in some cases being suicidal for a group. Extreme cases can include ideologies such as political lesbianism or certain religions which advocate against sexual intercourse, completely ending any possibility of future progeny for the adherents of such beliefs. While most belief practices are not this extreme, in part because they get evolutionarily selected against in the long-run, slight dysfunctional beliefs in religions and ideologies on a collective level can be functional for an individual to adhere to because it's advantageous for status signalling or boosting one's status.

### Why Understanding the Psychology of Belief is Crucial

People who are interested in politics or philosophy are always forced to contend with the fact that disagreement is inevitable. There will always be people who disagree with your particular ideas, and while to some extent many of these disagrements can be mended through rational argumentation, oftentimes it is very difficult to change the minds of people. It becomes easy to dismiss someone's ideas as merely being a function of them being irrational or stupid, as it means that we don't have to question our own beliefs and we can easily ignore people who disagree with us. But none of us are supermen. We all have flaws, and so it is important to understand why people actually believe the things they do as opposed to merely dismiss them, as understanding where people's thinking can go wrong can assist in helping us understand where our own thinking may go wrong.

### Are Beliefs Genetic?

As discussed in [On Biological Determinism](https://prometheandissident.github.io/psychology/#on-biological-determinism), the first law of behavioral genetics states that all human traits are at least partially heritable. From this, we should expect that human beliefs would also be in part genetic in origin. Research suggests that political views appear to be roughly 40% heritable<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-014-9648-8</ref>, if not more<ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2013/12/09/study-on-twins-suggests-our-political-beliefs-may-be-hard-wired/</ref>. This varies heavily with political sophistication, with people high in political sophistication having an estimated heritability of political views of 74%<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science/article/genes-ideology-and-sophistication/91C7C343BBA8801732F62E7D55B16676</ref>. Similarly, heritability estimates for religious belief range from around 27 percent to 62 percent, suggesting that religiousity also has a substantial genetic component to it<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3045647/</ref>.

This is not to say that some people have a single "Christian" gene or that some people have a single "liberal" gene in them which automatically makes them have a certain set of beliefs. Genes do not completely determine what beliefs a person will have and furthermore, this heritable component of belief comes from a large number of genes which affect a large number of psychological traits which create channels through which genes influence political belief. Research suggests that there is significant genetic overlap between political views and a variety of psychological traits, such as cognitive ability and personality<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154620300553</ref>, suggesting that much of these beliefs are byproducts of indirectly related psychological characteristics.

### Understanding Religious Belief

Religious belief is in some sense one of the most fundamental beliefs that people can have. Not only does it deeply affect the psychological states of people in terms of the communities and experiences such beliefs can bring to those who adhere or don't adhere to them, but religious belief also does back to animistic beliefs which hunter-gatherers had at the beginning of the evolution of humanity<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27154194/</ref>. While I am agnostic towards the idea that a god exists, I hold nonetheless that the reasons generally given for religious belief are irrational and that religions have generally speaking made false claims about the world. That being said, I have an appreciation for religion and recognize its importance and significance to humanity. Given that religious belief is so ubiquitous across times and places, it would be naive to suggest that it has never conferred any evolutionary advantages or other related advantages to it. The evolutionary advantage of religion most likely comes down to its ability to foster social cohesion, which as I argued in [Psychology of Belief](https://prometheandissident.github.io/psychology/#psychology-of-belief) is one of the fundamental reasons why people will tend to believe the things they do on a macro level. Religion functions as a package which helps to explain a number of questions which have been historically or continue to be difficult to answer. These include questions around the origin of humanity or the world itself and what the purpose of humanity is. It gives people a mission and a set of rituals and practices which help foster a stronger community among the religion's adherents. It is therefore not surprising to see how many societies across so many different periods of time had religious beliefs of one form or the other: it's human nature to have it.

Quantitative research backs up this narrative. Conservative religiousity is associated with high levels of a sense of purpose in life<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/009164718601400105</ref>. For socially connected individuals, a religious belief in itself has minimal impact on their sense of purpose in life. However, for those who are socially disconnected, being highly religious predicted greater levels of purpose in life<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12401</ref>. Because though religion brings people social connection in many cases, controlling for it may only tell the effect of theistic belief in sense of purpose and not the broader effect of religiousity in general. Furthermore, religiousity and spirituality is associated with better mental health<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508619.2020.1729570</ref>, lower depressive symptoms and less anxiety<ref>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.877213/full</ref>, as well as increased life satisfaction<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364086091_A_Meta-Analysis_of_ReligionSpirituality_and_Life_Satisfaction</ref>. Finally, religion overall plays a protective role in preventing suicide<ref>https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/155/5/413/171404</ref><ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131715</ref>. This can be seen in terms of both suicide attempts and completed suicides, although religion does not reduce suicidal ideation<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7310534/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20have%20found%20lower,after%20adjusting%20for%20social%20support</ref>. This may be due to religion providing access to a supportive community, shaping a person’s beliefs about suicide, providing a source of hope and providing ways to interpret suffering.

Beyond the effects that it can have on an individual level, religiosity also appears to have positive social externalities in terms of crime. Religion is negatively associated with crime on both an individual level<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022427801038001001#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20the%20meta,effect%20on%20individuals'%20criminal%20behavior</ref> and a societal level<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000232</ref>, as well as being negatively associated with involvement in delinquent behaviors<ref>https://scholarlycommons.obu.edu/articles/131/</ref>.

However, some reasearch does suggest that higher levels of religiosity can lower societal trust more broadly<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268111001223</ref>. There appear to be two reasons why this is theorized to be the case. Firstly, between groups religion can exacerbate boundaties between adherents of one faith and adherents of another or non-adherents, as more extreme religious belief can fuel between-group polarization. This can potentially lower trust in a society. Secondly, on an internal level, certain religions which make large moral demands of individuals, such as telling them to guard one another against sin, might lead to individuals adhering to such religions naturally distrusting those who are in their own communities. It should be noted that in the context in which religion was evolving, human communities were not even close to as large as they are today, meaning that there was essentially no opportunity for religious diversity to fluorish. Hence, between-group polarization would have been a non-factor in the evolution of religious belief as there wouldn't have been any opportunity for between-group polarization to emerge in the first place. While it could make the case for why religion might be more maladaptive today in societies with large populations and oftentimes large religious, cultural, and ethnic diversity, it cannot be used to make the case that religion was always maladaptive.

With regards to internal lack of social trust, this mechanism may actually be adaptive for a religious community and foster social cohesion. If it leads to distrust through a greater level of enforcement of existing norms, then this suggests that the social cohesion of the religious community is being better maintained than it would be otherwise. Research suggests that integration in religious communities furthers trust while religious socialization and the importance of god lower trust<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/26651394?seq=1</ref>. The community aspect of religion increases trust, while the social norm enforcement arms of religion, namely religious socialization and a belief in the importance of god, while lowering social trust, probably bring up social cohesion due to less deviance from the established norms.

But just because religious belief is adaptive to believe in doesn't mean that it is true. And in many countries around the world, a lack of religious affiliation is rapidly growing<ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2025/06/09/how-the-global-religious-landscape-changed-from-2010-to-2020/</ref>. Furthermore, while religiosity was in past times likely associated with high intelligence as it was seen as high-status, nowadays there is a negative relationship between intelligence and religiosity. Possible reasons include that intelligent people are less likely to conform, that intelligent people tend to adopt an analytic rather than intuitive thinking, and that several functions such as compensatory control, self-regulation, self-enhancement, and secure attachment, are also conferred by intelligence<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1088868313497266</ref>. Furthermore, scientists are significantly less likely to believe in the existence of a god compared to the general public<ref>https://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/scientists-and-belief/</ref>. As time goes on, the amount of claims stored within religious texts that can be independently and reliably assessed will merely grow. And consistently, it is found that these claims are false, such as the age of the earth, the origin of life and of humanity, and more. Therefore, while I do see religious belief as conferring benefits, if religion is to survive in any form, I believe it must take a form that is drastically different from anything which it has taken before.

It is furthermore the case that religious belief probably stems in part not simply from the social cohesion benefits it brings, but also from its consistency with certain underlying instincts humans have, namely hyperactive intentionality detection. A common theory that psychologists have for why religion evolved concerns the notion of a "hyperactive agency detection device" (HADD), the notion that people will be biased in favor of assigning agency to particular phenomena, such as a rustling in the bushes. This served an evolutionary advantage as it led to humans being more cautious than they might have been otherwise, as such instances of agency detection could be real threats such as a predator which we haven't yet seen. An alternative theory which has been developed is the notion of a hyperactive intentionality detection device (HIDD), which is similar to HADD but occurs when a person treats objects as if they have particular intentionality to them. Lisdorf (2007) showed that this theory is more parsimonious and more fully explains religious phenomenon while also being consistent with neurological research on the subject<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-16691-009</ref>. But regardless of whether HIDD or HADD is the more correct theory, this points to an intuition that humans have which can lead them towards believing in religious ideas even in the absence of any substantive evidence. It seems natural to many people to assign intentionality or purpose to things, even when there might not be any.

### Understanding Political Belief

The domains of religion and politics are very commonly distinguished in discourse. Regardless of the actual merits of doing so, it is the case that the origins of political belief and the origins of religious belief are, on a foundational level, very similar. Many of the neurobiological correlates of politics as the same as those of religion<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5180221/</ref><ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7195862/</ref>, suggesting that religion and politics are neurologically the same thing or very similar.

One interesting question which arises is what I call "the aggregation problem". Essentially, the aggregation problem asks what mechanisms exist that lead to certain political beliefs correlating with one another and not other political beliefs. For example, why does a support for gun rights positively correlate with opposition to abortion? Many people who argue about these topics will naively attempt to connect these issues together and argue that a position on one leads to a framework that justifies the other. But in reality, there's a large number of different philosophical frameworks which would lead to any combination of beliefs regarding abortion and gun rights.

Religion can get around this problem much more easily. Given that religious adherents generally subscribe to the inerrancy of a text, such as the Bible or the Quran, the reason why various religious beliefs aggregate can be explained as an adherent consistently adhering to a particular religious text. But in the absence of religious texts (or quasi-religious texts for the most part) in politics, this becomes a larger problem in politics.

Certainly, one can argue that there are some philosophical frameworks which connect beliefs together that are more coherent than others, or are more in line with our underlying preferences than others. Perhaps abortion and gun rights come from one of those frameworks, which is why the beliefs tend to correlate in the way they do. But most people are not thinking in terms of these broader philosophical frameworks which connect beliefs. Perhaps ideas are chosen based on those who do actually think about these things, and thus even without thinking through a coherent framework people arrive at one simply through social osmosis. But this raises the question: why listen to one person over another?

This can't simply be luck. As shown previously, beliefs have a significant genetic component to them (see [Are Beliefs Genetic?](https://prometheandissident.github.io/psychology/#are-beliefs-genetic?)), so if this is what explains differences in beliefs it cannot be a merely random process. The best theory I have for this is that beliefs are in part derived from underlying genetic psychological predispositions. In other words, various psychological traits which people have can predict their political beliefs.

Intelligence is perhaps one of the most obvious traits to think about in regards to this. Higher intelligence tends to be related to political beliefs in several ways. Firstly, intelligence is related political beliefs which emphasis freedom and/or individualism. Research suggests that libertarians (economically right-wing, socially left-wing) tend to be the most intelligent<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042366</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289614000373</ref><ref>https://www.econlib.org/archives/2015/01/intelligence_ma_1.html</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emil-O-W-Kirkegaard/publication/313890514_Cognitive_Ability_and_Political_Preferences_in_Denmark/links/58adc44b92851cf7ae85ac79/Cognitive-Ability-and-Political-Preferences-in-Denmark.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289618300667</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211046808</ref>, followed by liberals (economically and socially left-wing) and then conservatives (economically and socially right-wing)<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.2027</ref>. This appears to be due to beliefs in personal and economic liberalism both being correlated with intelligence<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emil_O_W_Kirkegaard/publication/313890514_Cognitive_Ability_and_Political_Preferences_in_Denmark/links/58adc44b92851cf7ae85ac79/Cognitive-Ability-and-Political-Preferences-in-Denmark.pdf</ref>, with personal liberalism being more strongly related to intelligence than economic liberalism. It furthermore appears that there is a "general factor" of belief in personal and economic liberalism, meaning that beliefs in freedom in one domain correlate with beliefs in freedom in another.

Secondly, intelligence appears to be related to conformity to a degree. The correlation between a specific ideology and intelligence tends to vary across cultures <ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611001425</ref>, and there is evidence to suggest that a lot of the relationship between ideology and intelligence is a function of which beliefs are mainstream, with mainstream beliefs being associated with higher intelligence<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/unique-everybody-else/201305/intelligence-and-politics-have-complex-relationship</ref>. In addition, intelligence is also related to believing political ideas which are popular but not necessarily true. For example, whites who attribute lower black socioeconomic status to genes (ie are race realists) have on average 8.5 lower WORDSUM IQ points than whites who espouse environmentalism<ref>https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights</ref>. This is despite the fact that empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports the notion that genetic IQ differences explain the majority if not all of the socioeconomic disparity between blacks and whites (see [Unfair Bias as a Factor in Disparities](https://prometheandissident.github.io/race/#unfair-bias-as-a-factor-in-disparities)).

Finally, intelligence may be related to more rational beliefs in certain domains when they correlate positively with social status. For example, research suggests that general cognitive ability is associated with a lower inclination to believe various conspiracies and paranormal phenomena, albeit only among individuals who strongly value epistemic rationality<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30624183/</ref>. Intelligence is also associated with thinking more like economists, who tend to among other things, trust market mechanisms<ref>https://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/pdfs/intelligencethinklike.pdf</ref>. Given that intelligence is heritable at around 0.8 (see [On Intelligence](https://prometheandissident.github.io/psychology/#on-intelligence)), these relationships are almost certainly "genetic" by extension.

Another psychological domain where political differences have been shown to exist concerns personality. Right-wingers tend to acore lower in personality trait openness and higher in personality trait conscientiousness compared to left-wingers. There is also some evidence suggesting right-wingers also tend to have lower neuroticism and agreeableness, and higher extraversion<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656612001158?via%3Dihub</ref><ref>https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=tdr</ref>. The correlation between personality traits and political orientation is a function of an innate common genetic factor, as opposed to being causal in one direction or another<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3809096/#:~:text=The%20results%20suggest%20that%20personality,innate%20common%20underlying%20genetic%20factor</ref>.

Similarly, there exists differences in moral foundations across people of differing political beliefs (see [The Emergence of Morality in Social Groups](https://prometheandissident.github.io/psychology/#the-emergence-of-morality-in-social-groups) for a discussion of moral foundations theory). Liberals have greater endorsement of the harm/care and fairness/reciprocity foundations compared to the other 3 foundations, while conservatives endorse and use the 5 foundations more equally<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-05192-002</ref>. Furthermore, liberals tend to express compassion toward less structured and more encompassing entities, supporting universalism, while conservatives express compassion toward more well-defined and less encompassing entities, supporting parochialism<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/kafw6v.pdf</ref>. In other words, liberals tend to support an expansion of the moral circle. Higher perceptions of social dangers and greater emphases on the binding moral foundations relative to the individualizing foundations is associated with conservatism<ref>http://timbates.wdfiles.com/local--files/group-project/Leuwen%20and%20Park.pdf</ref>.

- Discuss decline of religion, also examine evidence in favor of notion that "leftism" is a religion in a way that "rightism" is not generally speaking
- It's not clear to me that left-right distinction is actually useful to examine in an objective sense, but because it is perceived as useful phenomenologically, people who self select into these cateogories will probably have objective differences even if the left-right distinction was arbitrarily arrived at. Maybe left-right isn't the most fundamental distinction, or maybe we need two or three dimensions to examine political belief in the modern age.
- Of course models are always going to be oversimplifications, the question is whether the model is sufficiently explaining the phenomenon in a way that's useful to us.

### Mobbing and Other Group Dynamics

The notion that group dynamics disincentivize the pursuit of truth and lead to irrationality may run in opposition to the intuitions of many people. But this reality is best illustrated through discussing research on group social dynamics and how they form beliefs about individuals and ideas. Perhaps the most well-studied aspect of this is the notion of mobbing, which is a phenomenon which can occur in a wide vaiety of contexts. But for our purposes, the focus will be primarily, but not exclusively, on mobbing in the context of academia, where its relationship to truth can thus be more explicitly established.

Academic mobbing is a non-violent, sophisticated ganging up behavior adopted by academics to emotionally wear a colleague down through unjustified accusation, humiliation, general harassment and emotional abuse. These are directed at the target under a veil of lies and justifications so they are hidden to others and difficult to prove. Campuses are common places for academic mobbing to occur, and is done through shunning, gossip, ridicule, bureaucratic hassles and withholding of deserved awards. Bullies use mobbing activities to hide their weaknesses and incompetence. Targets are often innovative high achievers with good integrity and principles<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4170397/</ref>. There are a number of conditions that increase a person’s vulnerability to mobbing, that are either inside or outside the control of the target<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/unkindlyart.htm</ref>:

* Being different from most colleagues in an elemental way such as sex or race
* Being exceptionally high-achieving in teaching or research such that colleagues’ envy is aroused
* Publicly dissenting from politically incorrect ideas
* Defending a pariah on campus or the larger cultural arena

Mobbing is best understood as a social contagion, where people surrender their independence of mind. Pooling of people’s judgments is often a step toward truth, but it is only when the judgments are independent and uninfluenced by one another. In crowds, people can be irrational in their judgments. The main perpetrators of mobbing are unlikely to ever change their minds about the target, especially when ambiguity is involved<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/takeaways240723.html</ref>. In a typical mobbing case, apologies do not dampen but rather inflame the hostility of mobbers. Mobbers will generally either misconstrue the apology as a confession of worse wrongdoing than the target intends, or reject the apology as inadequate, insincere, misdirected or a said too late<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/takeaways240723.html</ref>. The sociologist Kenneth Westhues, who extensively studies mobbing, has a rough checklist of 16 mobbing indicators<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/checklist.htm</ref>:

* By standard criteria of job performance, the target is at least average, probably above average.
* Rumours and gossip circulate about the target’s misdeeds: “Did you hear what she did last week?”
* The target is not invited to meetings or voted onto committees, is excluded or excludes self.
* Collective focus on a critical incident that “shows what kind of man he really is.”
* Shared conviction that the target needs some kind of formal punishment, “to be taught a lesson.”
* Unusual timing of the decision to punish, e. g., apart from the annual performance review.
* Emotion-laden, defamatory rhetoric about the target in oral and written communications.
* Formal expressions of collective negative sentiment toward the target, e. g. a vote of censure, signatures on a petition, meeting to discuss what to do about the target.
* High value on secrecy, confidentiality, and collegial solidarity among the mobbers.
* Loss of diversity of argument, so that it becomes dangerous to “speak up for”or defend the target.
* The adding up of the target’s real or imagined venial sins to make a mortal sin that cries for action.
* The target is seen as personally abhorrent, with no redeeming qualities; stigmatizing, exclusionary labels are applied.
* Disregard of established procedures, as mobbers take matters into their own hands.
* Resistance to independent, outside review of sanctions imposed on the target.
* Outraged response to any appeals for outside help the target may make.
* Mobbers’ fear of violence from target, target’s fear of violence from mobbers, or both.

Ordinarily, targets of mobbing are scarred for life<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/unkindlyart.htm</ref>. They often develop trauma-related PTSD<ref>https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/4040932</ref>. In extreme cases, mobbing can result in suicide or murder-suicide. The targets’ position and influence in the organization is destroyed. Because the workplace has a web of social connections, targets tend to get ostracized and isolated, and colleagues shy away from the target out of fear of guilt by association. Targets exhibit profound feelings of self doubt, shame, worthlessness, humiliation, unhappiness and desperation. They become withdrawn and alienated from their colleagues, friends and sometimes families. Academic mobbing can be responsible for anxiety, depression and somatization syndrome. Target's obsessive preoccupation with the mobbing experience can have a negative impact on communication, intimacy and sex, work, parenting and household management within the family. One study estimated that 15% of suicides in Sweden were directly attributed to workplace mobbing<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4170397/</ref>.

Fundamentally, mobbing is rooted in the impulses we share with many other species. It is the coming to the surface, the expression in distinctly human ways, of instincts we are born with, tendencies to which we are genetically, physically inclined. This doesn’t mean that it’s inevitable or desirable, but it does mean that mobbing cannot easily be legislated out of existence, as if it were purely cultural<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/graz0701.htm</ref>. It is something which is natural to people.

Much of this discuss thus far is fairly abstract and, from first glance, would mainly concern irrational perceptions of people's character that would have little to do with political or religious beliefs. But the reality is that mobbing very oftentimes nowadays occurs against individuals who go against progressive orthodoxies in universities. The more an academic discipline has been influenced by postmodernism, which elevates subjectivity and puts objective truth into doubt, the more likely mobbing is to occur in it<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/takeaways240723.html</ref>. This is because the more ambiguous the truth is on something, as will necessarily be the case with the more social or metaphysical phenomena that so often characterize politics and religion respectively, the more that the social realm will bleed into any discussions of such issues, thereby causing group dynamics to emerge. It is thus quite common for mobbing to occur against individuals who differ from prevaling beliefs of a particular time period and place. While in academia today, this may take the form of mobbing those who reject progressive political views, a few centuries ago it may take the form of individuals who question church teachings in their society.

There is in fact a good case to be made that mobbing today is more common than it would have been 50 years or a century ago. This is because of changes in how discourse is conducted. As Dr. Westhues points out, mobbing can occur in academic spaces due to conflicting and differing modes of discourse. Modern discourse is characterized by<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/regiftedxmas12.html</ref>:
- Personal detachment from the issues under discussion
- Values on confidence, originality, agonism, independence of thought, creativity, assertiveness, mastery of one’s feelings, a thick skin and high tolerance for your own and others’ discomfort
- Playfulness is legitimate: One can play devil’s advocate, speak tongue in cheek, overstate and use hyperbole, the object being not to capture the truth in a single, balanced monologue, but to expose the strengths and weaknesses of various positions
- Scathing satire and sharp criticism are also legitimate
- The best ideas are thought to emerge from mutual, merciless probing and attacking of arguments
- Participants are repeatedly forced to return to the drawing board and produce better arguments
- The truth is not to be located in a single voice but rather is to emerge from the conversation as a whole

Over the past half century, a competing mode of discourse, postmodern discourse, has become more entrenched in the academy. Its hallmarks include<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/regiftedxmas12.html</ref>:
- Persons and positions are closely related, with little insistence on keeping personal identity separate from the questions or issues under discussion
- Sensitivity, inclusivity and inoffensiveness are key values
- Priority on cooperation, collaboration, quietness, sedentariness, empathy, equality, non-competitiveness, conformity and a communal focus
- Tends to perceive the satire and criticism of modern discourse as vicious and personal attack driven by hateful animus
- Is oriented toward the standard measures of grades, tests and a closely defined curriculum
- Lacking means by which to negotiate or accommodate intractable differences within its mode of conversation, it will typically resort to antagonistic, demonizing and personal attacks on the opposition
- Will typically not try to answer opponents with better arguments, but silence them completely as hateful, intolerant, bigoted, misogynistic, homophobic, etc
- Has a feminine flavor in contrast to the masculine flavor of modern discourse
- Results in stale monologues and contexts that rarely produce strong thought, but rather tend to become echo chambers

Differences between these competing modes often play out in today’s culture wars. Sensitivity-driven discourses tend to lack tolerance for difference and disagreement, and will thus manifest a herding effect. Dissenting voices can be excluded and opponents attacked, which means that proponents of the postmodern mode of discourse have a tendency to engage in workplace mobbing. It is in roughly half of academic mobbing cases that this distinction between modern and postmodern discourse is relevant for analysis<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/regiftedxmas12.html</ref>.

#### Moral Panics and Personality Cults

Other types of group-related behavior which are often discussed include moral panics and personality cults. I am somewhat more skeptical of these notions than of the notion of mobbing, simply because the psychoogical dynamics which would explain these types of behavior seem less well explored. Furthermore, I inevitably get the impression that these labels are often used post hoc to deride something as opposed to trying to actually describe an objective phenomenon. Regardless of how they're applied, however, it seems plausible that they also exist and would function as other cases where the notion that groups can be more irrational than individuals is correct.

A moral panic is a situation in which public fears and state interventions greatly exceed the objective threat posed to society by a particular individual or group. State officials and the media create a symbiotic relationship in that politicians and law enforcement need communication channels to distribute their rhetoric and the media needs interesting news content to attract an audience and advertisers<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/wicked-deeds/201507/moral-panic-who-benefits-public-fear</ref>. Some researchers have offered three explanatory models for moral panics: grassroots, elite engineered, and interest group. Most likely, most moral panic episodes originate from grassroots and interest groups as opposed to elites. Active or latent stress at the grassroots level is a prerequisite for moral panics that provides the raw material for an episode. However, the way that stress or fear is directed is shaped by organizational activists who provide the focus and direction for moral panics. Some researchers critique the moral panic concept by asserting that case studies often proceed with the objective of demonstrating that the episode under study conforms to the moral panics profile rather than problematizing these relationships<ref>Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology: Moral Panic</ref>.

On the other hand, a cult of personality is a deliberately created system of art, symbolism and ritual centered on the institutionalized quasi-religious glorification of a specific individual. Since the 20th century, cult of personality has been most often used to refer to charismatic leader cults, a type of personality cult which is based on a political leader and designed to enforce their power, magnify their ideology, and legitimize the rule of the government associated with them. In the 20th century the rise of mass media led to the establishment and flourishing of many personality cults. Autocratic and repressive regimes sought to use these cults of personality to legitimize their power. Some cults were centered on figures who had already attained power or prestige, while others lent credence to new political ideologies<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/cult-of-personality</ref>.

While these were aimed at providing legitimacy to governments, the ultimate effect was to associate the entire cult of personality with the atrocities committed by these regimes. Increasingly, accusing a leader of being the subject of a cult of personality is a way to question that leader’s authority. Still, these persist in the 21st century<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/cult-of-personality</ref>. Only two characteristics of a cult of personality have been identified by all scholars. First, it is defined by a quasi-ubiquitous praise, manifested through eulogistic articles in mass media and adulatory public parades. Second, the adulation of the leader is not entirely sincere, but largely coerced through employing the state apparatus in the organization of the named parades<ref>https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/3f2fb7a8-c5f6-47f1-8560-d51dad76e57e/content</ref>.

Mobbing, moral panics, and personality cults are all situations where the reality of group irrationality can be shown to persist in a range of circumstances. Individuals can be irrational, but arguably groups can be more so.

Research across 21 nations shows that the propensity for ecological threat correlates with the short (S) allele frequency in the 5-HTTLPR, allelic frequency in the 5-HTTLPR and vulnerability to ecological threat both correlate with cultural tightness-looseness, susceptibility to ecological threat predicts tightness–looseness via the mediation of S allele carriers, and frequency of S allele carriers predicts justifiability of morally relevant behavior via tightness–looseness. Hence, there is an interplay between environmental, genetic, and cultural factors underlying contemporary differences in social behavior<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40167-013-0009-x</ref>.

This effect is greatest for those with the highest levels of political knowledge<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/political-ignorance-and-collective-policy-preferences/D4E790DE0197D8430A03D9B8993F199B</ref>.
- **Modelling Ideology -** A unidimensional model of ideology is incomplete when studying political ideology, as economic and social views have different determinants, suggesting that a model of ideology should have at least two dimensions to it<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12055</ref>.

### <span style="background-color:yellow">Correlates</span>

More intelligent people tend to be more ideologically intolerant<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-55298-001</ref>. Belief superiority is better predicted by extremity of political beliefs than by partisan affiliation<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-44136-012</ref>. Conservatives tend to be more ideologically intolerant than liberals, and extreme ideologists tend to be more ideologically intolerant than moderate ideologists<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-55298-001</ref>. Greater political knowledge is associated with affective polarization<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/20570473211063237</ref>.

**Cognitive Correlates:**

- **Cognitive Bias -** Both conservatives and liberals have motivated disbelief in political problems when averse to the solutions of such problems, such as conservatives not believing in climate change<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25347128/</ref>. Ditto et al. (2019) meta-analyzed the results of 51 experimental studies and found that liberals and conservatives had the same level of tendency to evaluate otherwise identical information more favorably when it supports one's political beliefs or allegiances than when it challenges those beliefs or allegiances<ref>https://cpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/faculty.sites.uci.edu/dist/c/602/files/2019/08/Ditto-et-al.-2018-Perspectives-on-Psychological-Science-paper.pdf</ref>. People perceive the world in a manner consistent with their political views, meaning there is a selective pattern of learning in which partisans have higher levels of knowledge for facts that confirm their worldview and lower levels of knowledge for facts that challenge them<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s0022381612000187</ref>. Liberals tend to be better at identifying flawed arguments supporting conservative beliefs while conservatives tend to be better at identifying flawed arguments supporting liberal beliefs<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550619829059</ref>. Conservatives and liberals have similar levels of desires to remain in their respective ideological bubbles<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2953780</ref>. Both liberals and conservatives find Stephen Colbert funny, but conservatives are more likely to report that Colbert only pretends to be joking and genuinely means what he says while liberals are more likely to report that Colbert used satire and was not serious when offering political statements. Conservatism also significantly predicted perceptions that Colbert disliked liberalism<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1940161208330904</ref>.

**Personality Correlates:**

Conservatives and liberals also have equal levels of narcissism, although they differ in the ways in which narcissists of each orientation tend to express their narcissism, where conservatives are more entitled and liberals are more exhibitionistic<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12380</ref>.

- **Dark Triad -** Individuals with dark triad traits (narcissism, machivaellianism, and psychopathy) more frequently signal virtuous victimhood, even after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables that are more commonly associated with victimhood. Victim signalling is associated with amoral manipulation and a narcissism of one's belief in their superior prosociality, and also predicts a person's willingness to engage in and endorse many ethically questionable behaviors, such as lying to earn a bonus<ref>https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ok-et-al.-2020.pdf</ref>.
- **Need for Security -** Needs for security and certainty generally yield culturally conservative but economically left-wing values<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0036170</ref>. Death anxiety, system instability, dogmatism and intolerance of ambiguity, needs for order, structure, and closure, and fear of threat and loss all positively predict political conservatism, while uncertainty tolerance, integrative complexity, and self-esteem negatively predict political conservatism<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-00782-003</ref>. The brains of right-wingers/conservatives tend to be more reactive to fear, aversive stimuli, sudden noises, and threatening visual images<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18801995/</ref><ref>https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(11)00289-2</ref><ref>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2011.0268#aff-1</ref>.
- **Emotional Abilities -** Emotional abilities are significantly and negatively related to socio-cultural and economic-hierarchical right-wing attitudes, as well as to blatant ethnic prejudice<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-41368-001</ref>.

**Lifestyle Correlates:**

- **Well-Being -** Conservatives tend to be happier<ref>https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260817</ref>, have more meaning in life<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550618768241</ref>, have better mental health<ref>https://news.gallup.com/poll/102943/republicans-report-much-better-mental-health-than-others.aspx</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339541044_Mental_illness_and_the_left</ref>, and are physically healthier<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2912481/</ref><ref>http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886919300054</ref>. These effects are due to a number of causes, most notably a belief in personal agency being a cause of the happiness and health effects<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2011.12.009</ref>. Interestingly, while conservatives tend to have better mental health than liberals, suicide rates tend to be higher in places that are more conservative or are run by more conservative governments<ref>https://jech.bmj.com/content/56/10/722</ref><ref>https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj-2021-069308</ref>. Individuals vulnerable to depression are less likely to identify with mainstream conservative parties, to vote for them, or to place themselves on the political right<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1354068820930391</ref>.
- **Sexuality -** Those who engage in more traditional sexual behaviors tend to be more socially conservative, while those who engage in more masturbation, risky sex, and casual sex, tend to be more liberal. Despite the narrower band of activities that conservatives engage in, those with more conservative orientations tend to be more satisfied with their sex life<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886916310364</ref>. Conservatives are those who are most likely to spend money on pornography, likely because such desires are repressed within conservatives<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-beast/200903/why-conservatives-spend-more-pornography</ref>.
- **Fertility -** Conservatives generally have more kids and have them earlier, as well as being more likely to be married. These gaps have gotten larger over time<ref>https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-conservative-fertility-advantage</ref>. One potential factor playing into this is that after women have children, they tend to adopt more conservative social attitudes around gender roles<ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w24740</ref>.
- **Alcoholism -** States that become more politically liberal tend to have increases in their demand for alcohol, with consumption of beer and spirits rising and consumption of wine potentially falling<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-wine-economics/article/abs/alcohol-consumption-and-political-ideology-whats-party-got-to-do-with-it/D7191B2F1C4F11D9527AFA6F06614912</ref>.
- **Charitability -** Conservatives are significantly more charitable than liberals<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X21000752</ref>. Liberals self-report more criminal conduct than do conservatives<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886916310996?via%3Dihub</ref>. Political and religious conservatism are both inversely related to child abuse rates, although only the religious conservatism effect remained after controlling for population density<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145213414004074</ref>.

**Demographic Correlates:**

- **Age -** Older Americans tend to be more conservative<ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/</ref>, and this is due to the effect of ageing increasing one's likelihood of being conservative<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379413000875</ref>.
- **Physical Appearance -** Right-wingers tend to be more attractive than left-wingers<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.12.008</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1017/pls.2017.18</ref>, partially due to attractive people being more likely to support inequality<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2014.03.002</ref>, as they earn more. Appearance is a substantial predictor of political ideology, as facial recognition technology can correctly identify political orientation in liberal-conservative face pairs significantly greater than at random<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7801376/</ref>. Female politicians with stereotypically feminine facial features are more likely to be republican<ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/09/120927130955.htm</ref>. The facts of politicians judged to be supporters of the Conservative Party are rated as more intelligent, attractive, honest, and of higher social class than the facts of politicians judged to be from the Labor Party. This effect exists regardless of the political allegiances of the observers<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3791063?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents</ref>. Taller individuals are more likely to support the Conservative Party, support conservative policies and vote Conservative<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/height-income-and-voting/2B6875BFB8B956963D1DBBD510A581CF</ref>. Self-perceived attractiveness is associated with support for group-based dominance and belief in legitimizing ideologies. This effect is mediated by subjective social class. Lower self-perceived attractiveness decreases subjective SES, which leads to a greater tendency to reject social hierarchies and to construe inequality in terms of contextual causes<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597814000223?via%3Dihub</ref>.

### <span style="background-color:orange">Behaviors/Thought Patterns</span>

- **Activism -** Consistent liberals and consistent conservatives are the people most likely to engage in activism and the political process<ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/section-5-political-engagement-and-activism/</ref>. Stereotypes and perceptions about activists reduce people's willingness to affiliate with activists and to adopt the behaviors these activists promote<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-42785-004</ref>.
- **Genetic Attributions -** Genetic attributions are more likely to be made by liberals, are associated with higher and not lower levels of tolerance of vulnerable individuals, and are unrelated with unseemly racial attitudes<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/696860</ref>. Both conservative economic and social political ideology indirectly predict homophobia through binding foundations<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28466228/#:~:text=Study%202%20found%20that%20both,between%20political%20ideology%20and%20homophobia</ref>.
- **Authoritarianism -** Right-wing authoritarianism and left-wing authoritarianism are separate constructs that reflect a shared constellation of personality traits, cognitive features, beliefs, and motivational values that are at the core of authoritarianism in general. Relative to right-wing authoriarians, left-wing authoritarians have more negative emotionality, are lower in dogmatism and cognitive rigidity, and express stronger support for state control. Left-wing authoritarianism is a strong predictor of behavioral aggression and participation in political violence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34383522/</ref>.
- **Discrimination -** Compared to conservatives, moderates and liberals are much less accepting of discriminatory actions. Conservatives tend to value employers' decision rights while others value utilitarian concerns<ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w30236#fromrss</ref>.
- **Interracial Interactions -** White liberals but not white conservatives present less competence to black interaction partners than white ones, suggesting that well-intentioned liberal whites may draw on low-status/competence stereotypes to affiliate with minorities<ref>https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/pv2ab</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:yellow">Religious Belief</span>

**Correlates:**

- **Human Rights -** Most human rights practices are worse in societies where citizens are more religious and that muslim majority nations provide less respect for almost all human rights<ref>https://muse.jhu.edu/article/730069/pdfimage</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Autism</span>

Interesting factoids about autism:

* Autistic people have particular morphological features which can strongly predict someone having autism<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21999758/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20473590/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22669539/</ref>.
* Premature mortality is markedly increased in ASD owing to a multitude of medical conditions<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/premature-mortality-in-autism-spectrum-disorder/4C9260DB64DFC29AF945D32D1C15E8F2</ref>.
* Neurotypical peers are less willing to interact with autistic people based on thin slice judgments. These do not change with increased exposure and occur across both children and adults<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40700#discussion</ref>. However, these biases disappear when impressions are based on conversational content lacking audio-visual cues. This suggests that style and not substance drives negative impressions of autistic people.
* Children with autism have significantly higher levels of suicidal ideation and higher rates of suicide attempts<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1750946712000931</ref>.
* Autism is highly heritable<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/4001896</ref>.
* People with autism display facial expressions less frequently, for a less amount of time, and are less likely to share facial expressions with others or mimic expressions. Their facial expressions are also lower in quality and less accurately judged. However, people with ASD do not express emotions less intensely nor is their reaction time slower in response to stimuli<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2037</ref>.
* People with ASD, primarily males, have more hypersexual and paraphilic fantasies<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789215/</ref>.
* Individuals with ASD are less able to understand and infer other people's beliefs, intentions, and feelings, less likely to respond to the specific emotions of people in pain, less cognitively aware of the belief in, intention of and feeling for others, and have less immediate response to the special emotions of people in pain. People with ASD are as likely to immediately share and resonate with the emotions of other people, and are more likely to share or become affectively congruent with others' emotional states<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6794557/</ref>.

Individuals with ASD on average appear to have more vulnerable narcissistic traits but not more grandiose narcissism traits. Autistic individuals have higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness, and extraversion on average. Because vulnerable narcissism is correlated with higher neuroticism, the association between autism and narcissism could be mediated by neuroticism. Narcissistic vulnerability may also mediate internalizing symptoms such as anxiety and depression in individuals with ASD<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37983956/</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Personality</span>

**Correlates:**

- **Well-Being -** Neuroticismis the strongest predictor of life satisfaction, happiness, and negative affect. Positive affect is predicted equally well by extraversion and agreeableness<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.197</ref>.
- **Academic Performance -** Academic performance correlates significantly with agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness. Correlations between conscientiousness and academic performance were largely independent of intelligence. Conscientiousness is as strong of a predictor of tertiary academic performance as intelligence, after controlling for secondary academic performance<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1037/a0014996</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Self Control</span>

Self control has a 60% heritability<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763418307905</ref>. Low self-control in childhood is associated with unemployment in adulthood, even after adjusting for intelligence, social class, and gender<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797615569001</ref>. It is also associated with lower social responsibility<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1962-04824-001</ref>, more disciplinary referrals<ref>https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v95y2011i11p1377-1385.html</ref>, in addition to differences in physical health, substance dependence, personal finances, and criminal offending outcomes<ref>https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1010076108</ref>. Assignment to different schooling opportunities is not significantly associated with child time preferences<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727271930091X</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Suicide</span>

Suicide is mainly associated with social isolation, such as marital status and living alone, loneliness, alienation, and belongingness<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30445391/</ref>. In terms of cross-country differences in suicide, high unemployment is positviely associated with male suicide, while income is negatively associated with male suicide up until a high threshold of income<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1069397103253708</ref>. Suicidal acts are significantly more likely to be fatal for men than for women<ref>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M19-1324</ref>. Between 1963 and 1975 the annual number of suicides in England and Wales showed a sudden and unexpected decline, inconsistent with trends in most other European countries. This appears to have been a result of the progressive removal of carbon monoxide from the public gas supply, which accounted for more than 40% of suicides in 1963. Suicide by domesic gas was essentially eliminated by 1975<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/449144</ref>.

Between 2000 and 2020, the US suicide rate exhibited an upward trend. Rising suicide rates in the US since 2000 were driven by an increase in the rates for middle-aged and older adults in the 2000s and by rising rates for younger people in the 2010s. The rise in middle-aged suicides was likely due to the great recession, while the increase in youth suicides appears to coincide with increased rates of social media usage and smartphone ownership<ref>https://www.nber.org/bh/20232/what-accounts-rise-suicide-rates-us</ref>.

The Asian economic crisis of 1997-1998 appears to be associated with a sharp increase in some but not all East/Southeast Asian countries. These increases were most closely associated with rises in unemployment<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953609000100</ref>.

The East German communist regime did not appear to increase suicide, contrary to documentation by the west. Whether it was monarchy, democracy, fascism or socialism, the frequency of suicide did not change significantly<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/26733028?seq=1</ref>.

Both being without work and adverse working conditions increase suicide risk<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20250312105141/https://sprc.org/news/unemployment-and-suicide/</ref>.

Following the 2008 economic crisis, there was a marked rise in suicide rates in European and American countries, which would translate into thousands of excess suicides<ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130917194948.htm</ref>.

The average cost of one suicide was $1,329,553. More than 97 percent of this cost was due to lost productivity. The remaining 3 percent were costs associated with medical treatment<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20180621143426/https://www.sprc.org/about-suicide/costs</ref>.

A number of studies have indicated that when lethal means are made less available or less deadly, suicide rates by that method decline, and frequently suicide rates overall decline. This has been demonstrated in a number of areas: bridge barriers, detoxification of domestic gas, pesticides, medication packaging, and others<ref>https://means-matter.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/saves-lives/</ref>.

Variation in state-level suicide rates is largely driven by rates of suicide by firearm. More than twice as many suicides by firearm occur in states with the fewest gun laws, relative to states with the most laws. Firearms are the most lethal method of suicide attempts, and about half of suicide attempts take place within 10 minutes of the current suicide thought, so having access to firearms is a suicide risk factor. The availability of firearms has been linked to suicides in a number of peer-reviewed studies<ref>https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/do-states-with-easier-access-to-guns-have-more-suicide-deaths-by-firearm/</ref>.

Social networking websites are utilized by suicidal and self-harming youth as a medium to communicate with and to seek social support from other users. Online social networking also leads to increased exposure to and engagement in self-harm behavior due to users receiving negative messages promoting self-harm, emulating self-injurious behavior of others, and adopting self-harm practices from shared videos. Greater time spent on social networking websites led to higher psychological distress, an unmet need for mental health support, poor self-rated mental health, and increased suicidal ideation<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6278213/</ref>.

Most people who have died by suicide have suffered from mental disorders, a percentage which could be at least 90%. Risk of suicide has been estimated to be 5–8% for several mental disorders, such as depression, alcoholism and schizophrenia<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6165520/</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Tattoos</span>

People with tattoos tend to be rated as less attractive, more promiscuous, and more heavy drinkers based on their appearance<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18089280/</ref>. While some stereotyping may be negative in this respect, there is a degree of accuracy to negative stereotypes about tattooed people.

People with tattoos are more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22153289/</ref>, including physical violence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12042538/</ref>, more drinking and illicit drug consumption, higher suicidal ideation/attempts and depression<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22726901/</ref>, psychiatric disorders such as antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2333825/</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080715204734.htm</ref>, higher levels of psychopathy and schizophrenia<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1781185/</ref>, higher impulsiveness, adventurism, empathy, and neuroticism<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15119003/</ref>, and have an earlier age of first intercourse and are more sexually active<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22616886/</ref>.

Moreover, people with tattoos are more likely to have experienced childhood abuse and neglect<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35449026/</ref>, and score about 5 points lower on IQ tests<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15119003/</ref>. They also appear to die earlier than those without tattoos, possibly due to health concerns but also potentially due to higher levels of risk-taking behavior<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24926092/</ref>. Tattoos may signify something traumatic or extreme in someone's life or may signify impulsiveness in itself.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Trigger Warnings</span>

Trigger warnings have no net effect on affective responses to material being warned about nor on educational outcomes<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993791/</ref><ref>https://osf.io/qav9m/</ref>. It doesn't decrease engagement with negative material but can in fact increase engagement with material. Additionally, trigger warnings reinforce trauma survivor’s views of their trauma being central to their identity and increase anticipatory stress<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2167702620921341</ref>. This suggests that trigger warnings at best do essentially nothing and at worst have small negative effects.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Physiognomy</span>

Facial width-to-height ratio is a predictor of one's propensity for aggressive behavior<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2570531/</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Eugenics/Genetic Enhancement</span>

Anomaly (2018) defended the concept of eugenics or genetic enhancement and advocated for numerous "eugenic" policy proposals. Policy proposals include free contraception, genetic education and counseling, and incentives and penalties<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40592-018-0081-2</ref>. Jonathan Anomaly believes that states should apply as little coercion as possible to facilitate the emergence of future people with desirable traits.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Altruism and Ethics</span>

Humans routinely help others to achieve their goals, even when the helper receives no immediate benefit and the person helped is a stranger. Such altruistic behaviors exist in human children as young as 18 months in age and also exist in chimpanzees although with less robust skills and motivations<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16513986/</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Weight Loss (PROBABLY NEEDS TO GO INTO HEALTH)</span>

Obesity is associated with higher all-cause mortality<ref>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1555137</ref>. Obesity has a substantial heritability, although there is significant variability in the heritability estimate across studies<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355836/</ref>. Reduced energy diets and weight loss medications result in some weight loss outcomes, while advice-only and exercise-alone had minimal effects<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17904936/</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Delay Gratification</span>

Contrary to expert opinion based on polling, delay of gratification times have been increasing over the past 50 years, with a fifth of a standard increase in ability per decade. These correspond to secular gains in IQ seen, suggesting a possible common cause<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289620300295</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Economic Outcomes</span>

Savings propensities are about 33% heritable, and individuals are born with a persistent genetic predisposition to a specific savings behavior. Parenting has some effect on savings among younger individuals but this effect decays over time<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/679284#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Belief</span>

Although many people may have the impression that people with conspiracy beliefs are very irrational and thus won't budge to new evidence, they in fact can. Research shows that belief in conspiracy theories can be reduced through rational argumentation<ref>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01525/full</ref>. This is in spite of the fact that many people who believe in conspiracy theories are motivated to do so, due to many people holding conspiracy theories having a need to uniqueness<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314188232_Too_special_to_be_duped_Need_for_uniqueness_motivates_conspiracy_beliefs</ref>.

On average, people had a harder time distinguishing between real and fake news if they were generation Z, non-male, less educated, and more conservative<ref>https://news.ubc.ca/2025/04/misinformation-susceptibility-who-falls-for-fake-news/</ref>.

Some argue that misinformation is something that you can be inoculated from by teaching people to identify surface-level fingerprints such as use of emotional language to detect misinformation. However, whether a claim is true or false is independent from these “fingerprints” and instead deals with whether it corresponds to reality, it’s in the interests of misinformation communicators to avoid these fingerprints, and the most widespread and effective misinformation techniques do that, these techniques are not inherently bad, and these fingerprints can risk detecting false positives. Evidence suggests that attempts to inoculate people against misinformation in general make people more likely to rate all information as false or manipulative, and fails to translate into generalized misinformation inoculation<ref>https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/misinformation-isnt-a-contagious</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Journalists</span>

Journalists generally prefer parties with more left-wing positions<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353756955_The_Left-liberal_Skew_of_Western_Media</ref>.

Americans’ trust in media is currently very low<ref>https://news.gallup.com/poll/651977/americans-trust-media-remains-trend-low.aspx</ref>.

## Cancel Culture

The term "cancel culture" has its political roots on black Twitter, where it referred to attempts to use it to call out behavior deemed racist or offensive and put it on blast into the news. Since then, the term has expanded and has no universally agreed upon definition. In identifying how individuals define cancel culture, research has revealed ten themes that are most commonly mentioned. They are overblown disagreement, financial consequences, withdrawing support, job and visibility loss, mob punishment, rewriting history, accountability, freedom of speech, silencing opposition, and social media call out. Republicans appear to be less supportive of cancelling than democrats<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10659129241261374</ref>.

Cancel culture, through disempowering opposition, can feel collectively empowering and validating for the group feeling targeted by the individual being cancelled<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10399695/#abstract1</ref>.

Contrary to the estimates of Americans, only a minority of individuals actually engage in sanctioning behaviors often defined under the umbrella of "cancel culture". While some claim that cancelling behavior is primarily driven by personal dislike of individuals, particularly members of the other party, rather than principled disagreements, Americans tend to sanction statements that offend their ideology regardless of who says them. When presented with comparable scenarios, Democrats and Republicans appear to cancel others at similar rates. The real-world difference where Democrats cancel more may be due to them being exposed to more "cancellable" statements<ref>https://ubwp.buffalo.edu/jopblog/2025/04/01/unraveling-a-cancel-culture-dynamic-when-why-and-which-americans-sanction-offensive-speech/</ref>.

About 40% of Americans report keeping quiet and holding back their true beliefs for fear of reprisal, significantly higher than during McCarthyism when only 13% of Americans reported censorship. Nearly one in four Americans are afraid to state certain opinions for fear of losing their jobs or standings in school<ref>https://americansforprosperity.org/blog/cancel-culture-fire-survey-results/</ref>.

Cancel culture can constitute a means of norm enforcement, particularly when other forms of enforcement such as legal ones are absent or unapplicable.

However, the extremeness of the punishment means that there's few behaviors which should probably be considered cancellable which wouldn't be addressed through some other means, such as legally or otherwise.

## Mobbing

One in 30 people is a serial bully with sociopathic traits, whose behavior profile includes compulsive lying, a Jekyll and Hyde nature, superficial charm, considerable capacity to deceive, arrested emotional development and a compulsive need to control<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4170397/</ref>.

## Post-Truth

Fake news spreads significantly more rapidly on Twitter than real news does. This is not due to bots that are programmed to disseminate inaccurate stories, but because of people retweeting false news items. Fake news stories are 70 percent more likely to be retweeted than true stories are. It also takes true stories about six times as long to reach 1500 people as it does for false stories to reach the same number of people<ref>https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-twitter-false-news-travels-faster-true-stories-0308</ref>.

The illusory truth effect occurs when prior exposure to fake news increases the chance of it being perceived as accurate. A study found that even a single exposure to a fake news headline increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy. However, prior exposure does not impact entirely implausible statements, like the earth being a perfect square. Although extreme implausibility is a boundary condition of the illusory truth effect, only a small degree of potential plausibility is sufficient for repetition to increase perceived accuracy<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317069544_Prior_Exposure_Increases_Perceived_Accuracy_of_Fake_News</ref>.

Trust in media, particularly news media, has become fragile, as there is a drop in trust in media. Algorithmic news recommender systems, while crucial in helping news consumers find and filter relevant information, have been identified as playing a key role in lower trust through their profit-driven logic, privacy and surveillance issues, lack of diversity, bias, contribution to the spread of misinformation and black-box operations. Lack of trust contributes to uncertainty regarding what you know and why<ref>https://www.algepi.com/how-to-understand-trust-in-news-recommender-systems/</ref>.

During the 2016 US presidential campaign, independent fact checker PolitiFact judged 70% of all statements by Trump to be false or mostly false, and 26% of Hillary Clinton’s. Research suggested that when people, including Trump supporters, received corrections of false claims Trump made, they believed the statements less. However, for Trump supporters there was no association between the extent to which they shifted their belief when a statement was corrected and their feelings for President Trump or their intention to vote for him<ref>https://cssn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beyond-Misinformation-Understanding-and-Coping-with-the-Post-Truth-Era-Stephan-Lewandowsky.pdf</ref>.


Misinformation doesn’t simply misinform, but can actually cause people to stop believing in facts altogether. People who are presented with both a persuasive fact and a related piece of misinformation experienced no change in belief overall, and hence the misinformation cancelled out the fact. Research suggests that corrections of misinformation are rarely fully effective: that is, despite being corrected, and despite acknowledging the correction, people by and large continue to rely at least partially on information they know to be false. This is known as the continued-influence effect. In some circumstances, when the correction challenges people’s worldviews, belief in false information may ironically even increase<ref>https://cssn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beyond-Misinformation-Understanding-and-Coping-with-the-Post-Truth-Era-Stephan-Lewandowsky.pdf</ref>.

Corrections are effective only when they do not directly challenge people’s worldviews (can  be done by affirming the self-worth of recipients or by making the correction more persuasive by graphical means), and when they explain why the misinformation was was disseminated in the first place or they must provide an alternative explanation of the relevant event. While misinformation is an important part of the post-truth malaise, post-truth cannot be reduced to misinformation. Post-truth must be understood as the creation of an alternative epistemology that does not conform to conventional standards of evidentiary support<ref>https://cssn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beyond-Misinformation-Understanding-and-Coping-with-the-Post-Truth-Era-Stephan-Lewandowsky.pdf</ref>.

Trends supporting the emergence of a post-truth world<ref>https://cssn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beyond-Misinformation-Understanding-and-Coping-with-the-Post-Truth-Era-Stephan-Lewandowsky.pdf</ref>:
* Decline in social capital and shifting values as a result, where people feel less trust and less of a sense of obligation to others
* Growing inequality, which increases political polarization. This appears to not be so much both parties drifting apart, but the republican party becoming so much more right-wing over time
* Declining trust in science
* Evolution of the media landscape. Number of media companies has increased greatly, flexibility and fractionalization offered by social media allows people to create echo chambers, also leads to heterogeneity among audiences in the extent to which they are misinformed about important issues. Online political discourse has become extremely uncivil, in part as a result of the psychological distance and associated deindividuation between online participants.

One role of post-truth statements is to distract the public from unwanted information or potentially unpopular policy actions There is also an increasing fluidity of allegiances: not only do facts not matter, but anyone can be turned into a friend or foe, even if it implies a departure from long-standing beliefs and principles<ref>https://cssn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beyond-Misinformation-Understanding-and-Coping-with-the-Post-Truth-Era-Stephan-Lewandowsky.pdf</ref>.

## Epigenetics

Epigenetics examines how cells control gene activity without changing the DNA sequence. Epigenetic changes are modifications to DNA that regulate whether genes are turned on or off. The epigenome is all of the modifications that regulate the activity/expression of the genes within the complete set of DNA in a cell/genome. Environmental influences, such as a person’s diet and exposure to pollutants can impact the epigenome. Epigenetic modifications can be maintained from cell to cell as cells divide and in some cases can be inherited through the generations<ref>https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/howgeneswork/epigenome/</ref>.

Epigenetic effects contribute to depression. Environmental stressors such as childhood adversity and recent life stress are associated with major depression (MDD), an effect which is mediated by a number of epigenetic modifications<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01519-z?error=cookies_not_supported&code=301d0659-aa9c-4a77-b5bc-110c8ed6a658</ref>.

Prenatal exposure to famine can cause epigenetic changes in a child that can last many decades<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2579375/</ref>.

Evidence for intergenerational transmission of stress in humans is supported empirically by data from holocaust survivor offspring cohorts and other populations<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2015247?error=cookies_not_supported&code=ee1ed8e1-bb26-413e-a85c-3d3f8cc3d0bd</ref>.

Epigenetic inheritance may account for a significant portion of “missing heritability” in GWAS studies<ref>https://humgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40246-015-0041-3</ref>.

## Crime vs Thought

Liberals are more likely to feel comfortable sharing their political beliefs, while conservatives are most likely to self-censor. Democrats are more likely to favor banning hate speech, saying offensive or insulting things about a group more than republicans, even when it’s about things that republicans favor such as the military and police<ref>https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/state-free-speech-tolerance-america#overview</ref>.

Leftists are more concerned with avoiding offending others when they speak<ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/05/05/4-political-correctness-and-offensive-speech/</ref>.

Liberals are cognitively speaking more flexible and tolerant of complexity and novelty, while conservatives are more rigid, more resistant to change and prefer clear answers. Liberals solve significantly more problems through insight instead of a step-by-step analytic fashion<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4869693/</ref>.

Conservatives tend to show more intolerance to groups perceived as more liberal, while liberals tend to show more intolerance to groups perceived as more conservative<ref>https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/the-ideological-conflict-hypothesis-intolerance-among-both-libera</ref>.

Conservatives had less favorable impressions than liberals of groups that were identified as liberal (e.g., African Americans, homosexuals), but more favorable impressions than liberals of groups identified as conservative (e.g., Christian fundamentalists, businesspeople). This suggests that prejudice exists across the ideological spectrum<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797612447820?icid=int.sj-abstract.citing-articles.137</ref>.

In reacting to victims of crimes, liberals tend to have a reparative mindset that directly addresses the needs and concerns of victims, while conservative responses are at least equally reflective of a punitive mindset that addresses victim harm through offender punishment<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228281541_Political_Ideology_and_Reactions_to_Crime_Victims_Preferences_for_Restorative_and_Punitive_Responses#:~:text=,associated%20with%20decreased%20confidence%20and</ref>.

Right-wing authoritarianism predicts both the extent to which people worry about social threats and the extent to which they support harsh punitive measures<ref>https://www.academia.edu/14032546/Authority_and_punishment_on_the_ideological_basis_of_punitive_attitudes_towards_criminals</ref>.

Liberals tend to be more empathetic than conservatives according to self reporting. This is corroborated by higher neural empathy responses in liberals compared to conservatives<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10281241/</ref>.

Harm and Fairness are considered individualizing because they emphasize the protection of individual wellbeing and rights. Authority, Loyalty, and Purity are considered binding because they emphasize duty, interdependence, tradition, and adherence to cultural and religious practices. Endorsement of group-oriented moral concerns was associated with more punitive and conservative attitudes, while endorsement of individual-oriented moral concerns was associated with less punitive and less conservative attitudes<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28150974/</ref>.

## Impact of Nationalism

National pride is correlated with greater personal well-being, but civic nationalists are on the whole happier than ethnic nationalists<ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/12/111209171944.htm</ref>.

Nationalism can improve social cohesion but can also increase protectionism and intolerance. There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between nationalism and government effectiveness, with most countries having a higher than optimal level of nationalism. Nationalism may also mitigate the effects of ethnic heterogeneity in former colonies through creating a new identity where there wasn’t one prior<ref>https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jcecon/v39y2011i3p431-451.html</ref>.

Group-based relative deprivation in New Zealand was found to be negatively associated with well-being. However, it was associated with higher nationalism which was itself associated with higher well-being. This suggests that endorsing beliefs about national identity or superiority can help a dominant ethnic group cope with perceiving that their group is deprived<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pops.12563</ref>.

## Autism and Belief

Many autistic people seem to be less susceptible to cognitive biases, and are thus better able to make judgments and reach decisions in a more rational manner. Some studies have found that autistic individuals are less influenced by the framing of a choice when deciding between options (framing effect). Autistic individuals have a reduced optimism bias, the bias where people tend to neglect information containing undesirable news but adjust their outlook in response to desirable news. Autistic individuals integrate information in a more objective and unbiased manner than is typical. Autistic people are less likely to fall for the sunk cost fallacy. Autistic individuals are more rational in their judgments about people. They are as likely as neurotypical individuals to show an understanding of race and gender stereotypes, but have lower implicit bias levels, which could be seen as a form of enhanced rationality<ref>https://psyche.co/ideas/autistic-people-challenge-preconceived-ideas-about-rationality</ref>.

Subcortical brain shape maleness is positively associated with autistic symptoms. This appears to be a function of the size, as after adjusting for size there is no difference in brain maleness between ASD and non-ASD individuals. This provides evidence in support of the extreme male brain hypothesis of autism. ASD is four times more common in males than females, and some autistic traits are associated with male-typical behavior. For example, men tend to score lower on empathy tasks, and adults with ASD irrespective of sex score the lowest. Men score on average higher than women on an attention-to-detail task, while individuals with ASD score the highest. Women tended to be empathizing, while men tended to be systematizing. The majority of males and females with autistic symptoms were systematizing<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8328919/</ref>.

Children with autism are less likely to conform to the majority in the line judgment task compared to children without autism. Autistic traits negatively correlate with likelihood to conform in the typically developing group<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24126871/</ref>.

People tend to act more prosocially when they know they are watched by others due to social reputation concerns. However, high-functioning autistic people are not influenced by the presence or absence of an observer, suggesting that people with autism lack the ability to take into consideration what others think of them<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3198313/</ref>.

Adults with asperger’s syndrome were no more or less likely to conform on average in Asch’s line judgment task, but were significantly more likely to adopt a consistently conforming or nonconforming strategy<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8040221/</ref>.

ASD children perform similarly in deception tasks if both groups have lower social components, but as the social components increase ASD children perform relatively worse, although perform the same on an absolute level<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311698028_Trust_and_Deception_in_Children_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders_A_Social_Learning_Perspective</ref>.

Although young school-aged ASD children did not blindly trust any information provided by the unfamiliar adult, they appeared to be more trusting in the adult informant than did their age- and ability-matched TD children<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022096513000994</ref>.

ASD people are less able to distinguish truth from lies, which increases risks of being manipulated<ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180522114817.htm</ref>.

## Neoteny

The human self-domestication hypothesis suggests that humans evolved to be friendlier and more cooperative by selecting their companions depending on their behavior. There are genetic similarities between humans and domesticated animals in their genes. There is evidence to suggest that modern humans, due to genetic differences affecting neural crest cells, have more prosocial cognition and a retracted face relative to other extinct humans in the course of our evolution. This suggests that the self-domestication hypothesis is true<ref>https://phys.org/news/2019-12-experimental-genetic-evidence-human-self-domestication.html</ref>.

Human childhood is uniquely prolonged among primates and mammals. While most mammals become self-sufficient within months or a few years, humans require over a decade. This is an adaptation rooted in life history theory, where in humans a significant portion of early life energy is devoted to brain development rather than physical growth or early reproduction. Abilities such as problem-solving, language and cultural transmission cannot be inherited genetically alone, and must be taught through extended periods of learning and interaction. Humans also exhibit secondary altriciality, meaning that even at birth infants are significantly more helpless than those of other species. This evolved as a tradeoff due to bipedalism and the limitations of the human birth canal<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/raising-resilient-children/202505/why-kids-take-so-long-to-grow-up</ref>.

There is a significant number of genes showing neotenic expression in humans compared to chimps and rhesus macaques, suggesting that in some regions of the brain humans are developmentally delayed. Humans, having delayed gray matter volume maturation, may as a result have an extended period of neuronal plasticity associated with active learning, providing humans with additional time to acquire knowledge and skills. Gene expression is delayed in humans regarding a number of neurological traits/features<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2659716/</ref>.

In humans, brain development is retarded compared with other primates, especially in some association areas. Neurons in these areas remain structurally immature throughout their lifespans and show an increase in the expression of the genes which deal with metabolism and the activity and synaptic plasticity in adulthood. The retention of juvenile features in some adult neurons has occurred in areas related to episodic memory, planning and social navigation. The increase in aerobic metabolism in these neurons may lead however to higher levels of oxidative stress, thus favoring the development of neurodegenerative diseases which are exclusive, or almost exclusive, to humans, such as Alzheimer's disease<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.21225</ref>.

From the middle pleistocene to recent times, there has been craniofacial feminization in homo sapiens (reduction in average brow ridge projection and shortening of the upper facial skeleton). This reflects changes in average androgen reactivity (lower levels of adult circulating testosterone or reduced androgen receptor densities), which in turn affect the evolution of enhanced social tolerance. This coincides with the past 200,000 years of human cultural evolution witnessing the persistent establishment of behaviors involving innovation, planning depth, and abstract and symbolic thought, or what has been called “behavioral modernity”<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271799237_Craniofacial_Feminization_Social_Tolerance_and_the_Origins_of_Behavioral_Modernity</ref>.

There is some evidence to suggest that humans also have become genetically more oriented towards self control as they evolved, which might also help to explain higher prosociality<ref>https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00134/full</ref>.

## Activism

Economic affluence, state capacity, women as a percentage of the total labor force and left corporatism (left party control and higher neocorporatism) contribute to greater aggregate protest potential. Ethnic grievances stemming from economic discrimination and percentage of protestants also contribute positively while language dominance suppresses protest potential<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/20628335?seq=1</ref>.

Mass political protests have increased globally by an annual average of 11.5 percent between 2009 and 2019. The size and frequency of recent protests are unprecedented historically, eclipsing historical examples of eras of mass protest. Common grievances overwhelmingly center on perceptions of ineffective governance and corruption. Protests have resulted in a broad range of outcomes, ranging from regime change and political accommodation to protracted political violence with many casualties. Factors that could increase the rate of protest include slowing global economic growth, worsening effects of climate change, and foreign meddling in internal politics via disinformation and other tactics<ref>https://www.csis.org/analysis/age-mass-protests-understanding-escalating-global-trend</ref>.

Social movement organizations (SMOs) and other civic organizations have historically been influential. The vast majority of studies suggest a positive relationship between movements or movement organizations and influence, but this disproportionately looks at large movements. Scholars of social movements have also found that certain issues and policies may be very difficult for movements to influence, including policies (a) closely tied to the national cleavage structure, (b) for which high levels of political or material resources are at stake, (c) regarding military matters, or (d) on which public opinion is very strong<ref>https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-120029</ref>.

One study estimates that 42% of protest movements in the 21st century achieved some demonstrable gain in line with their aims. More concrete reforms for which specific identifiable bodies have responsibility were more likely achieved via protest. Broader structural or systemic change by more complex bodies was less likely to be achieved by protest. Gaining mass support is essential, especially for disadvantaged or otherwise marginalized groups given that politicians are typically most responsive to the preferences of the most affluent and best resourced<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13684302241245660</ref>.

Looking at US black led protests between 1960-72, nonviolent protest triggers news framed in terms sympathetic to protesters, while violent protest led to a media focus on the need for law and order to control dangerous riots. Violent protest is met with police violence and shifts voting away from the cause, while nonviolent protest is met with voting towards the cause. Looking at the BLM protests 2020 and after, at the state level more protest was associated with more approved bills for police reform. However, at the city level more protest was associated with increases to police budgets in cities with larger shares of whites and republicans, suggesting a backlash against calls to defund the police<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13684302241245660</ref>.

Scholarship on left-wing campus movements shows a history of notable successes, such as hundreds of academic programs on topics like black studies, women’s studies, and Asian-American studies that now exist. Conservative movements seem to be less successful in achieving their goals on American college campuses. This may speak to a structural issue, that left-wing movements are mobilizing on their home turf in a sense<ref>https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/soc4.12603</ref>.

Liberals are more likely to engage in non-voting political activities, such as protesting, donating to political candidates or campaigns, and engaging in politics online, compared to their conservative counterparts<ref>https://source.colostate.edu/political-party-voter-turnout-research/</ref>.

Of the 34 largest single-day protests in the US, 32 promoted liberal causes. Student protesters tend to operate at Kohlberg’s postconventional level of moral judgment, while non-protestors score at the conventional level. Conventional morality is followed mostly by conservatives, while post-conventional morality is mostly followed by liberals. Liberals tend to be higher in political self-efficacy than conservatives, which is the belief that one’s public actions make a real difference. This may be a determinant of public protesting. High levels of openness to experience indicate a tendency to challenge tradition and establishments, which liberals tend to score high on. Protests require this and will thus most likely select for liberals. In contrast, conservatives prefer to work within traditional systems and respect the established order, and so may be more prone to engaging in activities, like voting, that adhere to these beliefs<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cui-bono/202506/do-liberals-protest-more-than-conservatives</ref>.

## Hyperconnectivity

There is a small positive association between social media use, depression, and anxiety<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39242043/</ref>.

However, one study which attempts to quantify the percentage of variance in adolescent well-being explained by technology use suggests technology use explains at least 0.4% of it<ref>https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2019-01-14-technology-use-explains-most-04-adolescent-wellbeing-new-study-finds</ref>.

Social media is associated with increased political participation and information consumption, which is likely to be beneficial for democracy. However, other associations such as declining political trust, increased populism and increased polarization are more likely to harm democracy. The beneficial effects tend to be observed in autocracies and emerging democracies while the detriments are more pronounced in established democracies<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01460-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=b81c66cf-9230-4f01-a69a-25df089ca34b</ref>.

## Norms

Tipping points in social convention have been found in more generalized settings, with the size of the critical mass required ranging from 10-40%<ref>https://www.asc.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2021-03/Experimental%20evidence%20for%20tipping%20points%20in%20social%20convention.pdf</ref>.

## Population Cycles

The world population is expected to peak in 2084 at 10.3 billion<ref>https://ourworldindata.org/un-population-2024-revision</ref>.

The demographic transition is a model that explains why countries go through a period of rapid population growth. It is a sequence of five stages<ref>https://ourworldindata.org/demographic-transition</ref>:
- Stage 1 - high mortality and birth rates - Little to no population growth
- Stage 2 - Mortality falls but birth rates still high - Leads to rapid population growth.
- Stage 3 - Low mortality and birth rates begin to fall - The birth rate starts to drop which leads to lower population growth. This is because when the mortality of children is not as high as it once was, parents adapt to the healthier environment and choose to have fewer children. The economy undergoes structural changes that make children less economically valuable, and as women gain more power within society and partnerships, they tend to on average have fewer children than before.
- Stage 4 - Mortality and birth rates are low
- Stage 5 - Uncertain. The population may rise or fall again.

## Anti-Intellectualism

Rigney (2007) defines three types of anti-intellectualism which each originates from its own institutional or socio-structural matrix<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229936616_Three_Kinds_of_Anti-Intellectualism_Rethinking_Hofstadter#:~:text=,structural%20origin%3A%20Anti</ref>:
- Anti-rationalism - Associated primarily with religious structures, it takes two forms. The first is the perception that rationality is emotionally sterile, and the second is that rationality promotes relativism and social disintegration by challenging the sanctity of absolute beliefs
- Anti-elitism - Associated with indigenous populist movements and populist movements that aim to appeal to the “common man’s interests”, this takes the form of hostility towards intellectuals

Anti-intellectualism is a distrust of intellectuals and experts. Rural social identification significantly predicts greater anti-intellectualism, while anti-intellectualism is not significantly associated with rural residency alone. This is because residency doesn’t necessarily indicate psychological attachment<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8807672/#:~:text=Anti,S</ref>.

Anti-intellectualism is associated with not only the rejection of policy-relevant matters of scientific consensus but also support for political movements (ex Brexit) and politicians (George Wallace, Trump) who are skeptical of experts. These effects can be mitigated. Verbal intelligence plays a strong role in mitigating anti-intellectual sympathies<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324442277_The_Dynamics_and_Political_Implications_of_Anti-Intellectualism_in_the_United_States#:~:text=intellectual%20rhetoric,to%20gains%20in%20mass%20educational</ref>.

Epistemic hubris is the expression of unwarranted factual certitude. Epistemic hubris is prevalent, bipartisan, and associated with both intellectualism (an identity marked by ruminative habits and learning for its own sake) and anti-intellectualism (negative affect toward intellectuals and the intellectual establishment). Correlates of epistemic hubris are distinctly partisan, where intellectuals are disproportionately democratic, while anti-intellectuals are disproportionately republican<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/intellectualism-antiintellectualism-and-epistemic-hubris-in-red-and-blue-america/37C9F95A5DF4F81BAF69677DC6C9C972</ref>.

Anti-intellectualism challenges the ability to maintain and increase public compliance with expert-guided covid health directives<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01112-w?error=cookies_not_supported&code=cb643ea1-fcae-4675-a84f-56a5dabf2597</ref>.

Across 68 countries, most people trust scientists and agree that scientists should engage more in society and policymaking. Higher levels of trust tend to be among women, older people, residents of urban (versus rural) regions, people with high incomes, religious people, educated people, liberal people and left-leaning people<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02090-5?error=cookies_not_supported&code=540f4ace-765d-4c5e-ad3e-5bf51b3255c9</ref>.

Loziak & Piterová (2024) finds two inversely related clusters of attitudes, one is populist attitudes, distrust in experts, belief in simple solutions and a conspiracy mentality. The other is trust in the media, trust in politicians and external political efficacy<ref>https://sjps.fsvucm.sk/index.php/sjps/article/view/440</ref>.

## Dysgenics

Genes that contribute to educational attainment are under negative selection in humans. The impact of higher POLYedu scores (the polygenic score for educational attainment) is due mainly to delayed reproduction, in part because those with high POLYedu scores delay reproduction to pursue education. However, it appears that higher POLYedu scores have a substantial effect on delayed reproduction that is independent of the actual education attained. POLYedu is positively correlated with longevity and HDL cholesterol levels, and negatively negatively correlated with obesity, high-fasting glucose levels, and smoking. Thus, the decline of genetic propensity over time has an effect on the population that is not limited to education<ref>https://www.decode.com/decode-study-shows-variants-sequence-genome-contribute-educational-attainment-negative-selection/</ref>.

Over the second half of the twentieth century, the association of economic status with fertility and the association of the number of siblings with their education flipped from generally positive to generally negative. Because large families switched from investing in more education to investing in less, heterogeneity in fertility across families initially increased but now largely decreases average educational attainment. While changes in GDP per capita, women's work, sectoral composition, urbanization, and population health do not explain the reversal, roughly half of it can be attributed to the rising aggregate education levels of the parent generation. The results are consistent with two classes of theories of the fertility transition: (1) those based on changing preferences over the quality and quantity of children and (2) those incorporating subsistence consumption constraints<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w19128/revisions/w19128.rev0.pdf</ref>.

The link between fertility and intelligence has been consistently negative for successive birth cohorts in the US from 1900-1979. The decline of genotypic intelligence of whites is estimated at 0.75 IQ points a generation<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016028960300103X</ref>.

In the US, natural selection has been slowly favoring lower education attainment in both males and females, at about a rate of -1.5 months of education per generation. This pales in comparison with the increases in educational attainment observed in contemporary times<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27402742/</ref>.

In Norway, high-IQ males have delayed but ultimately higher fertility than low-IQ males<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10300504/</ref>.

In terms of global fertility differentials, both GDP and intelligence independently reduce fertility, while the effects of liberal democracy are weak and inconsistent. At present rates of fertility and mortality and in the absence of changes within countries, the average IQ of the young world population would decline by 1.34 points per decade and the average per capita income would decline by 0.79% per year<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19323856/</ref>.

One study finds a small negative correlation between intelligence and fertility in the US<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19485565.1999.9988992</ref>.

A study of the Icelandic genealogical database shows steady decline in POLYEDU. Based on the estimated effect of POLYEDU on the intelligence quotient (IQ) and the fact that POLYEDU only captures a fraction of the overall genetic propensity, the authors estimated that the change of the gene pool by itself would lead to a decline of 0.30 IQ points per decade. The authors conclude that as POLYEDU is only a fraction of the full genetic component of educational attainment, this trend could have a marked effect on IQ if it persists over the course of several centuries. Notably, however, IQ scores are known to have increased by 13.8 points between 1932 and 1978 (known as the Flynn effect), which suggests that changes in the socioeconomic and technological environment may mask a decreased genetic propensity for IQ<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.9?error=cookies_not_supported&code=3816f60f-cd79-41c8-86fd-abbf25b65abd</ref>.

A study finds a slight negative correlation of -0.14 between standard progressive matrices scores and the number of siblings in Libya, indicating only marginal dysgenic fertility<ref>https://eric.ed.gov/?q=FERTILITY&ff1=autLynn%2c+Richard&id=EJ1001678</ref>.

There is a negative correlation of -0.73 between IQ and fertility across nations. This is estimated to have decreased genotypic IQ by 0.86 points from 1950-2000, with a further decline of 1.28 points in genotypic IQ from 2000-2050. In the period 1950-2000 this decline was compensated for by a rise in phenotypic intelligence known as the Flynn effect but recent studies in four economically developed countries have found that this has now ceased or gone into reverse. It seems probable that this "negative Flynn Effect" will spread to economically developing countries and the whole world will move into a period of declining genotypic and phenotypic intelligence<ref>https://eric.ed.gov/?q=FERTILITY&ff1=autLynn%2c+Richard&id=EJ784467</ref>.

**Fertility -** There is a small negative correlation between cognitive ability and fertility among modern humans<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/0160-2896(95)90012-8</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2017.05.002</ref>. There is strong assortative mating for intelligence<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976231105382</ref>. Intelligence is positively associated with childlessness<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25546071/</ref>. There exists a Jensen effect on dysgenic fertility, meaning that the more g loaded a test score is, the more it is associated with lower fertility<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32184024/</ref>. Polygenic scores that predict higher earnings, education and health also predict lower fertility<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/41zw1p.pdf</ref>. This may suggest that earnings-increasing human capital may either increase or decrease fertility through income and substitution effects in the labor market.

## Overprescription

Across rich countries, antidepressant use has been on the rise, with doctors in some countries writing prescriptions for more than 1 in 10 adults. This is raising concerns about overprescription of pills<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/20/antidepressant-use-rise-world-oecd</ref>.

The FDA has approved the use of antipsychotic medications in some children and adolescents with severe emotional and behavioral disorders. However, recent trends show a 2-5 fold increase in the use of antipsychotic medications in preschool children<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3778027/</ref>.

In some countries, ADHD diagnoses are surging tenfold, which appears to be a product of marketing, where any fidgeting behavior is pathologized and seen as requiring treatment<ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141118125447.htm</ref>.

There has been a significant surge in treatments for gender dysphoria for young people. There appears to be a rising level of professional disagreement over whether this is a good thing or not<ref>https://bmjgroup.com/gender-dysphoria-is-rising-and-so-is-professional-disagreement/</ref>.

There has been a significant rise in the number of people in England obtaining central nervous system (CNS) stimulants and medicines for ADHD. The number of prescription items dispensed has increased in line with the number of patients. However, researchers estimate that ADHD is still underdiagnosed and undertreated<ref>https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/feature/special-report-charting-the-rise-in-adhd-prescribing</ref>.

Rates of overdiagnosis of bipolar disorder range from 4.8% to 67%<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3856145/</ref>.

## Dysgenics

There has been a decline in general cognitive ability over the course of the 20th century that has been observed in the United States, United Kingdom and Iceland. This can be traced to differences in fertility by education<ref>https://www.anthro1.net/p/the-great-decline</ref>.

Higher paternal age is associated with an increased risk of autism<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16953005/</ref>.

Paternal-age-related de novo mutations are related to increased risk for autism, congenital heart disease, neurodevelopmental disorders with epilepsy, intellectual disability and schizophrenia<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11039-6#Sec7</ref>.

## Social Media and Discourse

Research suggests that on twitter, virality predicts moral outrage in response to tweets about controversial issues even when controlling for the specific content of the tweet. This appears to be due to virality increasing people’s feelings of danger as a result of the tweet<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38421751/#:~:text=PubMed%20pubmed,virality</ref>.

In online social networks, the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increases their diffusion by a factor of 20% for each additional word. This was bounded by group membership, as moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them<ref>https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1618923114</ref>.

Social media platforms reward expressions of moral outrage through an increased number of likes and shares, changing the incentives surrounding the tone of political conversations<ref>https://news.yale.edu/2021/08/13/likes-and-shares-teach-people-express-more-outrage-online</ref>.

Social media users overperceive levels of moral outrage felt by individuals and groups, which inflate beliefs about intergroup hostility<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01582-0?error=cookies_not_supported&code=b0a59680-467b-497a-8c20-dcb3f438391c</ref>.

## Social Isolation

Social capital is the connections among individuals social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them. Social capital varies across many dimensions, but the most important distinction is between bridging (inclusive) and bonding (exclusive) social capital. Bonding social capital networks are inward-looking and tend to reinforce exclusive identities and homogenous groups, such as ethnic fraternal organizations and country clubs. Bridging social capital networks are outward looking and include people across diverse social cleavages, such as the civil rights movement and youth service groups<ref>https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/putnam-bowling</ref>.

Social capital increased in the US until the 1970s and then suddenly decreased until the present. This trend is consistent across measures including political participation, civic participation, religious participation, workplace networks, informal networks, mutual trust and altruism, with a few exceptions. Putnam found that a number of factors had no statistically significant effect on the change in social capital, including educational deficiency, destruction of the nuclear family, race and racism, big government and the welfare state, and market economics. There were four social characteristics that passed the tests: pressures of time and money, mobility and sprawl, television and generational differences. Up to 50% is due to generational differences<ref>https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/putnam-bowling</ref>.

Social capital leads to improved social environments, such as safer and more productive neighborhoods, it makes business transitions easier as people are more trusting, it widens our awareness of mutual connectivity which can improve the quality of civic and democratic institutions, it increases and speeds up the flow of information which improved education and economic production, and it improves our health and happiness through both psychological and biological processes which require human contact. Unfortunately the effects of social capital are not always positive. Indeed, bonding social capital, in particular, can lead to destructive divisions within and between societies as groups develop a collective identity based largely on exclusion, which can restrict individual freedoms through social pressure. But this isn’t inherent to social capital, and Putnam provides evidence that liberty and fraternity (or bonding social capital) are mutually supportive<ref>https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/putnam-bowling</ref>.

Putnam has several suggestions for improving social capital<ref>https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/putnam-bowling</ref>:
- Educational reforms be undertaken, including improved civics education, well designed service learning programs, extra curricular activities and smaller schools.
- More family-oriented workplace
- Further efforts at new urbanism
- Religion become both more influential and tolerant
- Technologies that reinforce rather than replace face-to-face interaction should be encouraged
- Art and culture should become more interactive
- Politics requires campaign efforts and a decentralization of power

Americans are having less sex. This is not due to an increase of women in the workforce, or to couples in general working longer hours, or to pornography, as research has shown that none of them could be the culprit<ref>https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/americans_are_having_less_sex_but_is_that_a_problem</ref>.

## Inbreeding

Inbreeding is related to a lower intelligence, with the effects of inbreeding depression being most strongly correlated with the subtest's g loading<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/0191-8869(83)90054-5</ref>.

## TOADD

Contrarianism is positively correlated with the need for uniqueness, cultural independence, autonomous functioning, autonomy, and reactance (instinctive resistance to perceived attempts to control one’s behavior). It is negatively correlated with interdependence and social desirability bias. Personality-wise, contrarians tend to be higher in openness to experience and neuroticism, and lower in agreeableness and conscientiousness<ref>https://nuancepill.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-contrarianism</ref>.

Meritocracy exists insofar as talented people tend to be upwardly mobile socially while dullards tend to move down. Existing meritocracy is imperfect but generally good in the developed world. Skills correlate more with where people end up socioeconomically rather than where they’re originally from<ref>https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/intelligence-and-social-mobility</ref>.

People’s rational capacities have largely been developed in response to social pressures to mitigate practical concerns, such as effective persuasion, avoidance of manipulation, and maintaining or enhancing the standing of ourselves and our in-group<ref>https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/smart-people-are-especially-prone</ref>.

People who are highly educated, intelligent or rhetorically skilled are significantly less likely than most others to revise their beliefs or adjust their behaviors when confronted with evidence which contradicts their beliefs. Because they know more about the world or are better at arguing, they are better able to punch holes in data or arguments, come up with excuses, or reinterpret threatening information, and such people do that<ref>https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/smart-people-are-especially-prone</ref>.

People who are highly intelligent are potentially especially prone to tribalism, virtue signalling and self-deception. For example, they are much more likely to know what positions they “should” hold in virtue of their partisan/ideological identities, and so are more likely to align their beliefs to systematically accord with those identities. They are more likely to form strong opinions on issues by looking to partisan cues about what people on their side tend to believe<ref>https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/smart-people-are-especially-prone</ref>.

Research suggests that 88% of undergraduate students fake more progressive views than they really hold. This is often with the intent of appeasing professors or staying in the good graces of peers<ref>https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/faking-wokeness-to-fit-in</ref>.

Both people on the left and on the right tend to have equally high levels of obedience, it just tends to be towards different groups. Right-wingers tend to be more obedient towards traditions, commanding officers and religious authorities, while left-wingers tend to be more obedient towards civil rights activists and environmentalists<ref>https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/whos-more-obedient-left-or-right</ref>.



Research presenting people with both political and non-political syllogisms found that individuals were significantly better at solving syllogisms when the correct answer was consistent with their own political beliefs and significantly worse when it favored the opposing ideology<ref>https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/warning-political-ideology-may-impair</ref>.

As of 2025, 34% of college students at least rarely accept using violence to stop a campus speech, which is up from 24% in 2021. Similarly, 54% at least rarely accept blocking other students from attending a campus speech and 71% at least rarely accept shouting down a speaker to prevent them from speaking on campus<ref>https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/college-students-increasingly-believe</ref>.

There are several commonalities which extremists on both sides of the political spectrum have in common which distinguishes them from moderates. The first is higher levels of psychological distress. Second is cognitive simplicity, or the tendency to view the world in black and white terms. Third is overconfidence, although this is ironic as research suggests that political extremists are less knowledgeable than moderates, particularly the slightly left and slightly right. Finally, extremists on both sides tend to be more intolerant of their political opponents<ref>https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/the-psychology-of-political-extremism</ref>.

Research suggests that people on both sides of the political spectrum exaggerate the other side’s agreement with extreme views. The more that people overestimated how prevalent extreme views were on the other side, the more they disliked the other side and the less willing they were to engage with them in any way. People tend to be reluctant to challenge extreme views on their own side, and are hence more willing to express agreement with moderate views on their side than disagreement with extreme views<ref>https://www.stevestewartwilliams.com/p/imaginary-enemies</ref>.

Mind viruses in a technical sense can be defined as ideas which spread from person to person and reduce people’s evolutionary fitness or function. There are numerous examples of such things occurring throughout history. One example is the Xhosa cattle-killing movement, where in 1856 a 15 year old girl in what is now South Africa claimed that spirits told her that if the Xhosa kill all their cattle and destroy their crops, the dead would arise and spirits would sweep the European settlers of South Africa out to sea. This led to the vast majority of Xhosa slaughtering their cattle and destroying their crops, leading to a depopulation of the region from over 105,000 people to less than 27,000. About 40,000 Xhosa starved to death as a result, and the remaining population were forced to submit to the British. A less extreme and more recent example of a mind virus can be seen with Brazilian soap operas. Research suggests that access to one television group, Rede Globo, which had a near monopoly on soap opera production in Brazil, was responsible for 7% of Brazilian fertility decline over the period of 1979-1991<ref>https://arctotherium.substack.com/p/mind-viruses</ref>.

**Belief**

The backfire effect is fake<ref>https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1912440117</ref><ref>https://educationblog.oup.com/theory-of-knowledge/facts-matter-after-all-rejecting-the-backfire-effect</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37988954/</ref><ref>https://www.climatechangecommunication.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DebunkingHandbook2020.pdf</ref>.

While cognitive ability is related to more affective prejudice toward conservative groups and less toward liberal groups, individuals with higher cognitive ability are more in favor of freedom of speech for all groups<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550619896168</ref>.

Both emotional intelligence and cognitive ability uniquely predict less concern for political correctness and more support for freedom of speech<ref>https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1614-0001/a000385?journalCode=jid</ref>.

Polygenic scores for cognitive performance and educational attainment significantly predict political beliefs, suggesting a genetic origin of political beliefs and a causal link between intelligence and political beliefs<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289624000254</ref>.

Individuals high in psychopathy, fear of missing out, and narcissism are more likely to engage in online political activity. Conversely, higher cognitive ability is uniformly associated with lower levels of online political participation<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-05195-y</ref>.

**Sociobiology Intro**

Humans have undergone significant evolution in reproductive physiology and behavior. The estrous cycle of women has changed in two ways which affect sexual and social behavior. Menstruation is intensified, and the estrus, or period of female “heat”, has been replaced by virtually continuous sexual activity. Copulation is not initiated in response to conventional signs of estrus such as the changing of the color of the skin around the female sexual organs and release of pheromones, but by extended foreplay entailing mutual stimulation by partners. Traits such as protruding breasts are also permanent in humans. The flattened sexual cycle and continuous female attractiveness cements close bonds that are basic to human social life<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

**Plasticity of Social Organization**

The parameters of social organization, including group size, properties of hierarchies, and rates of gene exchange, vary far more among human populations than among other primate species. Part of this is because the members themselves vary. Even in the most simple societies individuals differ greatly<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

The controls governing human societies are not as strong and the effects of deviation are not as dangerous. There are numerous examples in anthropology of inefficiencies or pathological flaws in human societies that endure. For example, the slave society of Jamaica was a society in which clergymen were the “most finished debauchees” in the land. The institution of marriage was officially condemned among both masters and slaves, the family was unthinkable to the vast majority of the population and promiscuity was the norm. Education was seen as a waste of time and teachers shunned it. The legal system was deliberately a travesty of anything that could be called justice, and all forms of refinements, art and folkways were either absent or in a state of total disintegration. Only a small proportion of whites who monopolized almost all the fertile land on the island benefited from the system. And once they secured their fortunes they abandoned the land for their mother land, for they found it unbearable to live in Jamaica. This world lasted for nearly two centuries, and the people multiplied while the economy flourished<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

Variation in social structure might persist because of a lack of competition from other species, resulting in “biological release”. During the last ten thousand years man has been so successful in dominating its environment that almost any kind of culture can succeed for a while so long as it has a modest degree of internal consistency and does not shut off reproduction altogether<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

While cultures can being altered substantially over the course of a single generation, such as the drastic alteration of Irish society in the first two years of the potato blight or the shift in Japanese authority structure during the American occupation following the second world war, this doesn’t mean that genetics do not play a role in cultural variation. Substantial heritability exists for a variety of traits, and this has the potential to lead to cultural differences between populations<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

**Barter and Reciprocal Altruism**

Sharing is rare among nonhuman primates, but in man it is one of the strongest social traits. As a result only man has an economy, as high intelligence and symbolizing ability makes such a thing possible. Intelligence also allows exchanges to be stretched out in time, leading to reciprocal altruism. “The microstructure of human social organization is based on sophisticated mutual assessments that lead to the making of contracts.” Strangers are quickly but politely explored to determine a wide range of traits about them which has a very practical value. The presentation of a person can be expected to be deceptive to some degree, and some level is adaptive. If deception and hypocrisy are too low in someone, they can be taken advantage of by others. If they are too high, the person can expect ostracism. Complete honesty on all sides is not the answer<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

**Bonding, Sex, and Division of Labor**

The nuclear family is the building block of nearly all human societies. In such families, the family moves between regional communities maintaining close contact with primary kin. During the day women and children remain in the residential area while men forage for game or its symbolic equivalent in the form of barter or money. Sexual bonds are contracted and intended to be permanent, and sexual behavior is nearly continuous, largely disassociated from the act of fertilization<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

**Role Playing and Polyethism**

Modern people can play a variety of roles. Roles in human societies are different from castes of social insects. Members of human societies sometimes cooperate, but other times they compete for the limited resources allocated to their role-sector. The best role-actors gain a larger share of the rewards. Individuals attempt to move up in position by changing roles. Heritability of roles may be present given the heritability of traits such as intelligence and emotive traits. However, there is little evidence of a hereditary solidification of status, as the cares of India which have existed for 2000 years only differ slightly in blood type and other anatomical and physiological traits<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

Some forces work against the genetic fixation of caste differences. The first is that cultural evolution is too fluid, making numerous pathways of upward mobility. Even in stable societies, the daughters of lower classes tend to marry upward. Still, it may be that some broad roles are influenced by genetics<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

**Culture, Ritual, and Religion**

The rudiments of culture exist in other primates but culture infiltrating virtually all aspects of life is exclusive to humans. There is great amounts of cultural diversity among societies. Culture, including ritual and religion, can be interpreted as a hierarchical system of “environmental tracking devices”, or responses. The fastest cultural responses in industrial societies include fashions on dress and speech. Slower are political ideology and attitudes toward other nations, and slowest includes incest taboos or belief/disbelief in higher gods. Slowly changing forms of culture tend to be encapsulated in rituals. Most human rituals have more than a simple immediate signal value. They both label, reaffirm and rejuvenate the moral values of the community. The most elementary forms of sacred rituals are concerned with magic, or the active attempt to manipulate nature and the gods<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

Formal religion is focused on deeper and more tribally oriented beliefs. Its rites celebrate creation myths, attempt to win the favor of the gods, and resanctify moral codes. In more complex societies, polity and religion blend naturally, as kings rule by divine right but high priests often ruled over kinds by the higher rank of the gods<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

It is reasonable to infer that magic and totemism are direct adaptations to the environment and preceded formal religion in social evolution. Sacred traditions are a cultural universal as are creation myths or at least myths which situation the tribe in relation to the world. Belief in high gods is not universal however. One analysis found that only about 35 percent of hunter-gatherer societies included high gods in their sacred traditions<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

“The enduring paradox of religion is that so much of its substance is demonstrably false, yet it remains a driving force in all societies. Men would rather believe than know, have the void as purpose, as Nietzsche said, than be void of purpose.”

<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>

“To sanctify a procedure or statement is to certify it as beyond question and imply punishment for anyone who dares to contradict it.” This certification is used to serve the most important interests of the group. Another force leading to the formalization of morality and religion is the fact that extreme human social plasticity can be both a strength and a danger. If trusted to make rules on their own, a person risks chaos<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

“Human beings are absurdly easy to indoctrinate – they seek it.”

<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>

**Testosterone**

A number of studies have shown that there have been population-level declines in testosterone in men from the 1970s to early 2000s in the United States and Europe<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32151259/</ref>.

In research examining subjects participating in a simple task in which their payoff depended on the self-reported outcome of a die roll, subjects had the opportunity to affect their payoff by falsely reporting without fear of getting caught. Testosterone administration was found to substantially reduce the propensity for men to lie in this task<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23071635/</ref>.

Testosterone increases the propensity for humans to engage in fair bargaining behavior in the ultimatum game<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08711</ref> as well as social cooperation in public goods games<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11136</ref>.

Individuals with higher levels of testosterone tend to be more receptive to minority positions, and hence less susceptible to majority influence when forming their views<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550620945116</ref>.

Research suggests that testosterone is related to higher social dominance but lower physical aggression in early adolescence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8885586/</ref>.

Verbally bullied boys aged 12-13 tended to produce more testosterone than their nonbullied counterparts, although the opposite was true for girls who tended to produce less testosterone than their nonbullied counterparts<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19021234/</ref>.

**Generic Engineering**

People have an instinctive aversion to incest which is informed by an intuitive form of eugenics. Research suggests that the children of sibling incest have a more than 40% change of either dying prematurely or being born with a severe impairment. First cousins have about a 5% change of having children with a genetic problem, which is twice as likely as unrelated couples<ref>https://dissentient.substack.com/p/eugenicist</ref>.

Important thing to note is that now that genetic engineering is becoming increasingly likely to occur, everyone is becoming more explicitly pro-eugenics to some degree. Banning the technology or promoting it can both be seen as eugenic arguably.
