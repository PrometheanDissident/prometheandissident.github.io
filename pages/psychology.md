## <span style="background-color:orange">Heritability</span>

Across a large number of traits analyzed, there was a mean 49% heritability of the traits among populations<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3285</ref>.

Heritability is a very misleading concept for several reasons. It is often assumed to be the amount of a trait that is due to genetics, but there is no measure of this. There are several limitations to the notion of heritability<ref>https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.1400</ref>:

* First, heritability looks at the proportion of population variance in a trait that can be explained by population differences in genetics. This means that heritability estimates can be very different for the same trait depending on the population examined. For example, in the case of a population with very little environmental variation, you will have a significantly higher heritability estimate for a trait compared with a population with very high environmental variation.
* Second, given that all traits are filtered through genetics, it is impossible to actually separate out genetic from environmental effects. Genes turn on and respond in various ways depending on the environment, so the strict separation between genetic and environmental influences is highly dubious.
* Third, twin studies which are the hallmark of heritability estimates assume that identical twins have no more similar environments than fraternal twins, and thus attribute all differences between groups to genetics. However, identical twins are exposed to demonstrably similar environments than are fraternal twins, starting in the womb. Identical twins often share a placenta while fraternal twins always have two separate placentas. Identical twins that share a placenta have more similar IQs and personalities than identical twins who do not share a placenta. This effect however appears to be small and only limited to a few phenotypes<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-015-9745-3</ref>. More significantly, it is likely that identical twins will be treated in social interactions more similarly than fraternal twins, increasing the similarity of their environments further. This has been shown to undermine research finding a strong heritability for schizophrenia, as identical twins have a smaller differences in their level of bullying, sexual abuse, physical maltreatment, emotional neglect and abuse, and general trauma compared to fraternal twins<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25972816/</ref>. Only some of those traits could be reasonably suggested to be genetic. This is consistent with research suggesting that the equal environments assumption is not strictly valid for most outcomes, with a likely modest bias<ref>https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1080/19485565.1968.9987750</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.10.004</ref>.

Top 10 replicated findings from behavioral genetics<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691615617439</ref>:

* Finding 10. Abnormal is normal

## <span style="background-color:lightcoral">Intelligence</span>

### <span style="background-color:orange">G Factor</span>

The there exists a general intelligence, or g factor, which is highly heritable<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15651931/</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0160289614000099</ref>. General cognitive ability can predict academic performance, career potential, creativity, and job performance<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.86.1.148</ref>. There is expert consensus that g is an important non-trivial predictor or determinant of important real world outcomes, and that g tests are valid and generally do not have racial bias<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2008.03.007</ref>.

Rats display a general factor of intelligence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8510832/</ref>, as well as dogs<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016028961630023X</ref>. The g factor also exists amongst chimpanzees, and the more g-loaded cognitive abilities had more genetic variance and phenotypic variance and were more heritable, suggesting it is associated with high interspecies variance and evolves rapidly<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.04.002</ref>.

This general factor has been shown to also exist in international cognitive ability comparisons, suggesting it is a universal phenomenon<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.634</ref><ref>https://emilkirkegaard.dk//en/wp-content/uploads/The-g-factor-of-international-cognitive-ability-comparisons-the-homogeneity-of-results-in-PISA-TIMSS-PIRLS-and-IQ-tests-across-nations.pdf</ref><ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-01683-001.pdf</ref>.

In higher ability populations, cognitive ability tests are less correlated with one another and less g loaded<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5669751/</ref>.

### <span style="background-color:yellow">Heritability</span>

Intelligence is highly heritable at as high as 0.8<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5754247/</ref>. There are a very high number of genetic loci which have been found to be associated with intelligence<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3869</ref><ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04362-x?ref=iqpredictionnews</ref><ref>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.024554v3.full.pdf</ref>. High intelligence is also familial, heritable, and caused by the same genetic and environmental factors responsible for the normal distribution of intelligence<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/xd769q.pdf</ref>. Additionally, intellectual disability is heritable at 51%<ref>https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13560</ref>. Similarly, educational attainment is reasonably heritable<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69526-6</ref><ref>https://files.catbox.moe/3t8uvr.pdf</ref>.

**Wilson Effect:** The heritability of IQ increases with age, reaching a maximum of about 0.6-0.8<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-meta-analysis-of-11000-pairs-of-twins-shows-that-the-heritability-of-intelligence_fig1_265690996</ref>.

### <span style="background-color:yellow">Bias/Alternative Theories</span>

Possible sources of bias:

- **Test Anxiety -** Test anxiety does not induce measurement bias in aptitude and cognitive ability test scores<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2007.11.003</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.08.007</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2016.06.030</ref>. Rather, test anxiety is most closely related to psychometric g<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2013.11.003</ref>.
- **Test-Retest Gains -** IQ test-retest score gains are correlated with g loadings at -1, meaning that score gains are not g-loaded at all<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2006.07.006</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2018.10.004</ref>.

Alternative views of intelligence:

- **Emotional Intelligence -** Emotional intelligence can be reduced to g, personality trait agreeableness, and sex<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2003.11.014</ref>.
- **Multiple Intelligences -** Highly diverse tests of purely cognitive abilities are strongly g-loaded, suggesting that multiple intelligences do not exist<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2006.02.004</ref>.

### <span style="background-color:yellow">Correlates</span>

Individual-Level:

- **Crime -** Research suggests that intelligence is correlated with crime, most research suggesting independently of socio-economics status<ref>https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2123&context=jclc</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1996.tb01220.x</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886911000912</ref>. This predictive validity of IQ persists in cross-state comparisons<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886909005169</ref>. This relationship, however, is not perfectly linear. People who have very low intelligence have slightly lower criminality than people with fairly low intelligence, and people with very high intelligence have slightly higher criminality than people with fairly high intelligence<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016028961500077X</ref><ref>https://clcjbooks.rutgers.edu/books/criminal-genius-a-portrait-of-high-iq-offenders/</ref>. There is a small negative relationship between IQ and rearrest<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29954769/</ref>. Estimates of IQ across states and counties have shown to be negatively correlated with crime<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19529925/</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289613000190</ref>.
- **Individual Income/Wealth -** There is a relationship between an individual’s intelligence level and their future income. People with higher intelligence levels tend to have higher incomes<ref>https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=d6fdb1364dc3e73c44441ba55a15f1b9bc49265a</ref><ref>https://ifstudies.org/blog/can-intelligence-predict-income</ref>. Importantly, however, this relationship does not appear to translate perfectly in terms of total wealth. While intelligence predicts higher income, it has a quadratic relationship with financial distress<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289607000219</ref>. Therefore, it is not entirely clear how much net wealth is affected by intelligence. IQ is a better predictor of socioeconomic success than parental SES or grades<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11334871/</ref>. IQ and conscientiousness are also more important than SES for educational attainment<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11916378/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11058498/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29611892/</ref>. Maynard & Murnane (1979) looked at the impact of a negative income tax experiment and found that it increased the average reading achievement of children in grades 4 through 6, but not for older children<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25328893/</ref>. Similarly, Duncan et al. (2011) conducted a random monetary assignment experiment and found that an increase in annual income results in a substantial increase in young children's achievement<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28081903/</ref>. Financial stress can temporarily lower IQ<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32188746/</ref>. Childhood IQ is associated with class mobility in adulthood across all social classes<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32661290/</ref>. Polygenic scores have been identified that are associated with social mobility<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29049045/</ref>.
- **Educational Attainment -** Intelligence is a major predictor of school achievements, partially through more intelligent people having higher levels of motivation to succeed in school environments<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289615001269</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X18300691</ref>. Students attending selective schools tend to outperform their non-selective counterparts in national exams. However, there are substantial mean genetic differences between students of different school types on a polygenic score associated with higher education. After controlling for factors involved in pupil selection, there were no significant genetic differences between school types, and the variance in exam scores explained by school type dropped to less than 1%. This suggests that genetic and exam differences between school types are primarily due to heritable characteristics involved in pupil admission<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12578471/</ref>. Experiments suggest that the effects of interventions that raise IQ fade away following the intervention because children who receive the interventions lose their IQ advantage<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25281007/</ref>. Headstart gains are correlated at -0.8 with g loadings, suggesting that headstart gains are generally not on the g factor<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289614000932</ref>. Schooling gains are not g loaded<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31109385/</ref>.
- **Adoption -** Adopted siblings or peers have higher IQ scores than their nonadopted siblings or peers who stayed behind<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15740423/</ref>. These effects are not g-loaded<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886914005248</ref>.
- **Lead -** There is an inverse relationship between blood lead concentration and IQ and reading test scores<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1257652/</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22558/w22558.pdf</ref>. These effects are g loaded<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.09.005</ref>.
- **Health -** Higher intelligence is associated with a substantially lower risk of death, even after adjusting for childhood and adult socioeconomic status as well as education, although adult SES and education attenuate it substantially<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyq190</ref>. Research suggests that this effect is mostly genetic in origin<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyv112</ref>.
- **Fertility -** There is a small negative correlation between cognitive ability and fertility among modern humans<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/0160-2896(95)90012-8</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2017.05.002</ref>. There is strong assortative mating for intelligence<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976231105382</ref>. Intelligence is positively associated with childlessness<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25546071/</ref>. There exists a Jensen effect on dysgenic fertility, meaning that the more g loaded a test score is, the more it is associated with lower fertility<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32184024/</ref>. Polygenic scores that predict higher earnings, education and health also predict lower fertility<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/41zw1p.pdf</ref>. This may suggest that earnings-increasing human capital may either increase or decrease fertility through income and substitution effects in the labor market.
- **Brain Size/Chemistry -** Brain size is positively associated with g<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32076418/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25855618/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31473014/</ref>. This is of genetic origin as whole-brain gray and white matter is highly heritable<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32286890/</ref>, and there is a genetic correlation between intracranial volume and years of education<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32286899/</ref>, as well as intelligence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15922990/</ref>. Human intelligence can be predicted with some accuracy using neuroimaging techniques<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14749147/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25546071/</ref>.
- **Conspiracism -** General cognitive ability is associated with a lower inclination to believe various conspiracies and paranormal phenomena, but only among individuals who strongly value epistemic rationality<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30624183/</ref>.
- **Reaction Times -** Reaction time tasks correlate with psychometric intelligence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29795215/</ref>.
- **SAT -** The SAT is strongly correlated with g<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00687.x</ref>. Coaching has a small but positive effect on SAT scores<ref>https://meridian.allenpress.com/her/article-abstract/53/1/1/31190/Evaluating-the-Effect-of-Coaching-on-SAT-Scores-A?redirectedFrom=fulltext</ref>.
- **Inbreeding -** Inbreeding is related to a lower intelligence, with the effects of inbreeding depression being most strongly correlated with the subtest's g loading<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/0191-8869(83)90054-5</ref>.
- **Creativity -** There is a small and heterogeneous positive correlation between IQ and creativity<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30009212/</ref>.

**National-Level:** National IQ is correlated with a variety of educational, cognitive, economic, political, demographic, sociological, geographic, and climate variables<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27866536/</ref>. National IQ is positively correlated with economic development, and is the best predictor of economic growth<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29328072/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30191806/</ref>. Education and cognitive ability appear to be more important as developmental factors for GDP than economic freedom. Education and intelligence are more relevant to economic welfare than vice versa, but economic welfare also predicts education and intelligence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28201577/</ref>. A 1 point increase in a nation's average IQ is associated with a persistent 0.11% annual increase in per-capita GDP<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2006.00439.x</ref>. IQ is also associated with the production and exportation of more sophisticated/complex products<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289612001134</ref>. IQ is also a significant predictor of financial development<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.03.007</ref>.

### <span style="background-color:orange">Flynn Effect</span>

The average decadal IQ increase since 1951 has been 2.6 points<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4152423/</ref>. The Flynn effect is negatively correlated with g loadings at -0.38, suggesting the Flynn effect is not g loaded and that group differences and the Flynn effect have different causes<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289613000226</ref>. After correcting for increased guessing, the correlation between the flynn effect and g loadings goes down to -0.82<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289613001761</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:lightcoral">Political Orientation</span>

Whites who attribute lower black socioeconomic status to genes (ie are race realists) have on average 8.5 lower WORDSUM IQ points than whites who espouse environmentalism<ref>https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights</ref>.

Conservatism has a small negative relationship with IQ, but this effect is non-linear. Individuals with an IQ above 115 tend to score higher in conservatism than those with an IQ of 115, although still not as much as those with an IQ below 100<ref>https://www.emilkirkegaard.com/p/does-intelligence-have-nonlinear</ref>.

Republicans tend to have a wider range of beliefs in terms of attitude networks<ref>https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjso.12665</ref>:

<img src="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0ecbdd65-e5d7-462c-bb8d-a9664dcda6b6/bjso12665-fig-0002-m.jpg" alt="Attitude Network" width="500">

Vertical cultural transfer effects, the notion that parents through teaching their children pass down their values onto their children independently of genetics or assortative mating, is mostly untrue. Political interests are somewhat copied from parents when living at home, but quickly disappear when people get into adulthood<ref>https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/2018/09/vertical-cultural-transfer-effects-plausible-but-mostly-not-real/</ref>.

Conservatives tend to view liberals as more immature in terms of mental representations, while liberals tend to view conservatives as more savage in terms of mental representations<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37415508/#:~:text=Results%20suggest%20that%20partisans%20indeed,more%20strongly%20emphasizes%20savagery%20</ref>.

There is a positive link between increased paternal age and leftism, at r=0.12<ref>https://sociobiology.org/post/a-paternal-age-effect-on-leftism-is-detect</ref>. Traits that are changing due to mutational pressure are expected to be much more common with offspring from older fathers, suggesting that this implies a mutational load effect of leftism. Furthermore, older fathers themselves are not more leftist than younger fathers, meaning the paternal age effect is not due to differences in breeding patterns between leftists and non-leftists<ref>https://sociobiology.org/post/evidence-for-a-paternal-age-effect-on-left</ref>. However, this correlation goes away once controlling for age, sex and paternal education implying the mutational load hypothesis may be incorrect, although the sample size may mean the controls caused the test to be underpowered<ref>https://arctotherium.substack.com/p/against-the-mutational-load-hypothesis</ref>.

Cognitive ability mediates part of the link between genes and political orientations<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.12230</ref>.

Many of the neurobiological correlates of politics as the same as those of religion<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5180221/</ref><ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7195862/</ref>, suggesting that religion and politics are neurologically the same thing or very similar.


A large proportion of college students and college graduates will agree with statements made by Hitler about Jews if the words about Jews are replaced with words about whites<ref>https://unsafescience.substack.com/p/who-agrees-with-hitler</ref>.

Conservatives are worse at discerning true from false information in the news<ref>https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/87/2/267/7147091</ref>.

Left-leaning individuals are more likely to donate to charities in general as well as donate internationally<ref>https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2219676120</ref>.

There is substantial change in people’s individual-level moral foundations over time, and these do not appear to account for changes in political attitudes nor are they heritable to any significant degree<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12255</ref>.

### <span style="background-color:orange">Principles</span>

- **Conformity -** Individuals tend to conform to the group's opinion or censor their views in situations where people deliberately disagree with them. Conformity and censorship are most frequent among introverted, emotionally stable, and racial minority participants<ref>https://scholarworks.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&context=honorstheses</ref>.
- **Knowledge -** Ignorance of policy-specific information leads many to hold political views they wouldn't hold otherwise. This effect is greatest for those with the highest levels of political knowledge<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/political-ignorance-and-collective-policy-preferences/D4E790DE0197D8430A03D9B8993F199B</ref>.
- **Modelling Ideology -** A unidimensional model of ideology is incomplete when studying political ideology, as economic and social views have different determinants, suggesting that a model of ideology should have at least two dimensions to it<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12055</ref>.

### <span style="background-color:yellow">Heritability</span>

Political views appear to be roughly 40% heritable<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-014-9648-8</ref>, if not more<ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2013/12/09/study-on-twins-suggests-our-political-beliefs-may-be-hard-wired/</ref>. This varies heavily with political sophistication, with people high in political sophistication having an estimated heritability of political views of 74%<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science/article/genes-ideology-and-sophistication/91C7C343BBA8801732F62E7D55B16676</ref>. There is significant genetic overlap between political views and a variety of psychological traits, such as cognitive ability and personality<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154620300553</ref>, suggesting that much of these beliefs are byproducts of indirectly related psychological characteristics.

### <span style="background-color:yellow">Correlates</span>

**Cognitive Correlates:**

- **Intelligence -** Libertarians (economically right-wing, socially left-wing) tend to be the most intelligent<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042366</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289614000373</ref><ref>https://www.econlib.org/archives/2015/01/intelligence_ma_1.html</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emil-O-W-Kirkegaard/publication/313890514_Cognitive_Ability_and_Political_Preferences_in_Denmark/links/58adc44b92851cf7ae85ac79/Cognitive-Ability-and-Political-Preferences-in-Denmark.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289618300667</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211046808</ref>, followed by liberals (economically and socially left-wing) and then conservatives (economically and socially right-wing)<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.2027</ref>. This appears to be due to beliefs in personal and economic liberalism both being correlated with intelligence. However, this effect varies across cultures<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289611001425</ref>, and there is evidence to suggest that a lot of the relationship between ideology and intelligence is a function of which beliefs are mainstream, with mainstream beliefs being associated with higher intelligence<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/unique-everybody-else/201305/intelligence-and-politics-have-complex-relationship</ref>. More intelligent people tend to be more ideologically intolerant<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-55298-001</ref>. Belief superiority is better predicted by extremity of political beliefs than by partisan affiliation<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-44136-012</ref>. Conservatives tend to be more ideologically intolerant than liberals, and extreme ideologists tend to be more ideologically intolerant than moderate ideologists<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-55298-001</ref>. Greater political knowledge is associated with affective polarization<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/20570473211063237</ref>. Intelligence is also associated with thinking more like economists, who tend to among other things, trust market mechanisms<ref>https://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/pdfs/intelligencethinklike.pdf</ref>. Cognitive ability is positively related to both personal liberalism and economic liberalism<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emil_O_W_Kirkegaard/publication/313890514_Cognitive_Ability_and_Political_Preferences_in_Denmark/links/58adc44b92851cf7ae85ac79/Cognitive-Ability-and-Political-Preferences-in-Denmark.pdf</ref>. There exists a general factor of personal liberalism and economic liberalism.
- **Cognitive Bias -** Both conservatives and liberals have motivated disbelief in political problems when averse to the solutions of such problems, such as conservatives not believing in climate change<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25347128/</ref>. Ditto et al. (2019) meta-analyzed the results of 51 experimental studies and found that liberals and conservatives had the same level of tendency to evaluate otherwise identical information more favorably when it supports one's political beliefs or allegiances than when it challenges those beliefs or allegiances<ref>https://cpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/faculty.sites.uci.edu/dist/c/602/files/2019/08/Ditto-et-al.-2018-Perspectives-on-Psychological-Science-paper.pdf</ref>. People perceive the world in a manner consistent with their political views, meaning there is a selective pattern of learning in which partisans have higher levels of knowledge for facts that confirm their worldview and lower levels of knowledge for facts that challenge them<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s0022381612000187</ref>. Liberals tend to be better at identifying flawed arguments supporting conservative beliefs while conservatives tend to be better at identifying flawed arguments supporting liberal beliefs<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550619829059</ref>. Conservatives and liberals have similar levels of desires to remain in their respective ideological bubbles<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2953780</ref>. Both liberals and conservatives find Stephen Colbert funny, but conservatives are more likely to report that Colbert only pretends to be joking and genuinely means what he says while liberals are more likely to report that Colbert used satire and was not serious when offering political statements. Conservatism also significantly predicted perceptions that Colbert disliked liberalism<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1940161208330904</ref>.

**Personality Correlates:**

- **General Personality -** Right-wingers tend to have lower openness and higher conscientiousness compared to left-wingers. There is also some evidence suggesting right-wingers also tend to have lower neuroticism and agreeableness, and higher extraversion<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656612001158?via%3Dihub</ref><ref>https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=tdr</ref>. The correlation between personality traits and political orientation is a function of an innate common genetic factor, as opposed to being causal in one direction or another<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3809096/#:~:text=The%20results%20suggest%20that%20personality,innate%20common%20underlying%20genetic%20factor</ref>. Conservatives and liberals also have equal levels of narcissism, although they differ in the ways in which narcissists of each orientation tend to express their narcissism, where conservatives are more entitled and liberals are more exhibitionistic<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12380</ref>.
- **Dark Triad -** Individuals with dark triad traits (narcissism, machivaellianism, and psychopathy) more frequently signal virtuous victimhood, even after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables that are more commonly associated with victimhood. Victim signalling is associated with amoral manipulation and a narcissism of one's belief in their superior prosociality, and also predicts a person's willingness to engage in and endorse many ethically questionable behaviors, such as lying to earn a bonus<ref>https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ok-et-al.-2020.pdf</ref>.
- **Need for Security -** Needs for security and certainty generally yield culturally conservative but economically left-wing values<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0036170</ref>. Death anxiety, system instability, dogmatism and intolerance of ambiguity, needs for order, structure, and closure, and fear of threat and loss all positively predict political conservatism, while uncertainty tolerance, integrative complexity, and self-esteem negatively predict political conservatism<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-00782-003</ref>. The brains of right-wingers/conservatives tend to be more reactive to fear, aversive stimuli, sudden noises, and threatening visual images<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18801995/</ref><ref>https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(11)00289-2</ref><ref>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2011.0268#aff-1</ref>.
- **Emotional Abilities -** Emotional abilities are significantly and negatively related to socio-cultural and economic-hierarchical right-wing attitudes, as well as to blatant ethnic prejudice<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-41368-001</ref>.
- **Moral Foundations -** Liberals tend to express compassion toward less structured and more encompassing entities, supporting universalism, while conservatives express compassion toward more well-defined and less encompassing entities, supporting parochialism<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/kafw6v.pdf</ref>. In other words, liberals tend to support an expansion of the moral circle. Higher perceptions of social dangers and greater emphases on the binding moral foundations relative to the individualizing foundations is associated with conservatism<ref>http://timbates.wdfiles.com/local--files/group-project/Leuwen%20and%20Park.pdf</ref>. Liberals have greater endorsement of the harm/care and fairness/reciprocity foundations compared to the other 3 foundations, while conservatives endorse and use the 5 foundations more equally<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-05192-002</ref>.

**Lifestyle Correlates:**

- **Well-Being -** Conservatives tend to be happier<ref>https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260817</ref>, have more meaning in life<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550618768241</ref>, have better mental health<ref>https://news.gallup.com/poll/102943/republicans-report-much-better-mental-health-than-others.aspx</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339541044_Mental_illness_and_the_left</ref>, and are physically healthier<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2912481/</ref><ref>http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886919300054</ref>. These effects are due to a number of causes, most notably a belief in personal agency being a cause of the happiness and health effects<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2011.12.009</ref>. Interestingly, while conservatives tend to have better mental health than liberals, suicide rates tend to be higher in places that are more conservative or are run by more conservative governments<ref>https://jech.bmj.com/content/56/10/722</ref><ref>https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj-2021-069308</ref>. Individuals vulnerable to depression are less likely to identify with mainstream conservative parties, to vote for them, or to place themselves on the political right<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1354068820930391</ref>.
- **Sexuality -** Those who engage in more traditional sexual behaviors tend to be more socially conservative, while those who engage in more masturbation, risky sex, and casual sex, tend to be more liberal. Despite the narrower band of activities that conservatives engage in, those with more conservative orientations tend to be more satisfied with their sex life<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886916310364</ref>. Conservatives are those who are most likely to spend money on pornography, likely because such desires are repressed within conservatives<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-beast/200903/why-conservatives-spend-more-pornography</ref>.
- **Fertility -** Conservatives generally have more kids and have them earlier, as well as being more likely to be married. These gaps have gotten larger over time<ref>https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-conservative-fertility-advantage</ref>. One potential factor playing into this is that after women have children, they tend to adopt more conservative social attitudes around gender roles<ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w24740</ref>.
- **Alcoholism -** States that become more politically liberal tend to have increases in their demand for alcohol, with consumption of beer and spirits rising and consumption of wine potentially falling<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-wine-economics/article/abs/alcohol-consumption-and-political-ideology-whats-party-got-to-do-with-it/D7191B2F1C4F11D9527AFA6F06614912</ref>.
- **Charitability -** Conservatives are significantly more charitable than liberals<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X21000752</ref>. Liberals self-report more criminal conduct than do conservatives<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886916310996?via%3Dihub</ref>. Political and religious conservatism are both inversely related to child abuse rates, although only the religious conservatism effect remained after controlling for population density<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145213414004074</ref>.

**Demographic Correlates:**

- **Age -** Older Americans tend to be more conservative<ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/</ref>, and this is due to the effect of ageing increasing one's likelihood of being conservative<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379413000875</ref>.
- **Physical Appearance -** Right-wingers tend to be more attractive than left-wingers<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.12.008</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1017/pls.2017.18</ref>, partially due to attractive people being more likely to support inequality<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2014.03.002</ref>, as they earn more. Appearance is a substantial predictor of political ideology, as facial recognition technology can correctly identify political orientation in liberal-conservative face pairs significantly greater than at random<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7801376/</ref>. Female politicians with stereotypically feminine facial features are more likely to be republican<ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/09/120927130955.htm</ref>. The facts of politicians judged to be supporters of the Conservative Party are rated as more intelligent, attractive, honest, and of higher social class than the facts of politicians judged to be from the Labor Party. This effect exists regardless of the political allegiances of the observers<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3791063?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents</ref>. Taller individuals are more likely to support the Conservative Party, support conservative policies and vote Conservative<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/height-income-and-voting/2B6875BFB8B956963D1DBBD510A581CF</ref>. Self-perceived attractiveness is associated with support for group-based dominance and belief in legitimizing ideologies. This effect is mediated by subjective social class. Lower self-perceived attractiveness decreases subjective SES, which leads to a greater tendency to reject social hierarchies and to construe inequality in terms of contextual causes<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597814000223?via%3Dihub</ref>.

### <span style="background-color:orange">Behaviors/Thought Patterns</span>

- **Activism -** Consistent liberals and consistent conservatives are the people most likely to engage in activism and the political process<ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/section-5-political-engagement-and-activism/</ref>. Stereotypes and perceptions about activists reduce people's willingness to affiliate with activists and to adopt the behaviors these activists promote<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-42785-004</ref>.
- **Genetic Attributions -** Genetic attributions are more likely to be made by liberals, are associated with higher and not lower levels of tolerance of vulnerable individuals, and are unrelated with unseemly racial attitudes<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/696860</ref>. Both conservative economic and social political ideology indirectly predict homophobia through binding foundations<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28466228/#:~:text=Study%202%20found%20that%20both,between%20political%20ideology%20and%20homophobia</ref>.
- **Authoritarianism -** Right-wing authoritarianism and left-wing authoritarianism are separate constructs that reflect a shared constellation of personality traits, cognitive features, beliefs, and motivational values that are at the core of authoritarianism in general. Relative to right-wing authoriarians, left-wing authoritarians have more negative emotionality, are lower in dogmatism and cognitive rigidity, and express stronger support for state control. Left-wing authoritarianism is a strong predictor of behavioral aggression and participation in political violence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34383522/</ref>.
- **Discrimination -** Compared to conservatives, moderates and liberals are much less accepting of discriminatory actions. Conservatives tend to value employers' decision rights while others value utilitarian concerns<ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w30236#fromrss</ref>.
- **Interracial Interactions -** White liberals but not white conservatives present less competence to black interaction partners than white ones, suggesting that well-intentioned liberal whites may draw on low-status/competence stereotypes to affiliate with minorities<ref>https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/pv2ab</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:yellow">Religious Belief</span>

**Correlates:**

- **Suicide -** Religion overall plays a protective role in preventing suicide<ref>https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/155/5/413/171404</ref><ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131715</ref>. This can be seen in terms of both suicide attempts and completed suicides, although religion does not reduce suicidal ideation<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7310534/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20have%20found%20lower,after%20adjusting%20for%20social%20support</ref>. This may be due to religion providing access to a supportive community, shaping a person’s beliefs about suicide, providing a source of hope and providing ways to interpret suffering.
- **Mental Heath -** Religiousity and spirituality is associated with better mental health<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508619.2020.1729570</ref>, lower depressive symptoms and less anxiety<ref>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.877213/full</ref>, as well as increased life satisfaction<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364086091_A_Meta-Analysis_of_ReligionSpirituality_and_Life_Satisfaction</ref>.
- **Sense of Purpose -** Conservative religiousity is associated with high levels of a sense of purpose in life<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/009164718601400105</ref>. For socially connected individuals, a religious belief in itself has minimal impact on their sense of purpose in life. However, for those who are socially disconnected, being highly religious predicted greater levels of purpose in life<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12401</ref>. Because though religion brings people social connection in many cases, controlling for it may only tell the effect of theistic belief in sense of purpose and not the broader effect of religiousity in general. A sense of meaning in life is a crucial element of religious coping and psychological well-being<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4580713/</ref>.
- **Crime -** Religion is negatively associated with crime on both an individual level<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022427801038001001#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20the%20meta,effect%20on%20individuals'%20criminal%20behavior</ref> and a societal level<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886996000232</ref>, as well as being negatively associated with involvement in delinquent behaviors<ref>https://scholarlycommons.obu.edu/articles/131/</ref>.
- **Intelligence -** There is a negative relationship between intelligence and religiosity. Possible reasons include that intelligent people are less likely to conform, that intelligent people tend to adopt an analytic rather than intuitive thinking, and that several functions such as compensatory control, self-regulation, self-enhancement, and secure attachment, are also conferred by intelligence<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1088868313497266</ref>. Scientists are significantly less likely to believe in the existence of a god compared to the general public<ref>https://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/scientists-and-belief/</ref>.
- **Human Rights -** Most human rights practices are worse in societies where citizens are more religious and that muslim majority nations provide less respect for almost all human rights<ref>https://muse.jhu.edu/article/730069/pdfimage</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Autism</span>

Interesting factoids about autism:

* Autistic people have particular morphological features which can strongly predict someone having autism<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21999758/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20473590/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22669539/</ref>.
* Premature mortality is markedly increased in ASD owing to a multitude of medical conditions<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/premature-mortality-in-autism-spectrum-disorder/4C9260DB64DFC29AF945D32D1C15E8F2</ref>.
* Neurotypical peers are less willing to interact with autistic people based on thin slice judgments. These do not change with increased exposure and occur across both children and adults<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40700#discussion</ref>. However, these biases disappear when impressions are based on conversational content lacking audio-visual cues. This suggests that style and not substance drives negative impressions of autistic people.
* Children with autism have significantly higher levels of suicidal ideation and higher rates of suicide attempts<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1750946712000931</ref>.
* Autism is highly heritable<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/4001896</ref>.
* People with autism display facial expressions less frequently, for a less amount of time, and are less likely to share facial expressions with others or mimic expressions. Their facial expressions are also lower in quality and less accurately judged. However, people with ASD do not express emotions less intensely nor is their reaction time slower in response to stimuli<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aur.2037</ref>.
* People with ASD, primarily males, have more hypersexual and paraphilic fantasies<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789215/</ref>.
* Individuals with ASD are less able to understand and infer other people's beliefs, intentions, and feelings, less likely to respond to the specific emotions of people in pain, less cognitively aware of the belief in, intention of and feeling for others, and have less immediate response to the special emotions of people in pain. People with ASD are as likely to immediately share and resonate with the emotions of other people, and are more likely to share or become affectively congruent with others' emotional states<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6794557/</ref>.

Individuals with ASD on average appear to have more vulnerable narcissistic traits but not more grandiose narcissism traits. Autistic individuals have higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness, and extraversion on average. Because vulnerable narcissism is correlated with higher neuroticism, the association between autism and narcissism could be mediated by neuroticism. Narcissistic vulnerability may also mediate internalizing symptoms such as anxiety and depression in individuals with ASD<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37983956/</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Personality</span>

**Correlates:**

- **Well-Being -** Neuroticismis the strongest predictor of life satisfaction, happiness, and negative affect. Positive affect is predicted equally well by extraversion and agreeableness<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.197</ref>.
- **Academic Performance -** Academic performance correlates significantly with agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness. Correlations between conscientiousness and academic performance were largely independent of intelligence. Conscientiousness is as strong of a predictor of tertiary academic performance as intelligence, after controlling for secondary academic performance<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1037/a0014996</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Self Control</span>

Self control has a 60% heritability<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763418307905</ref>. Low self-control in childhood is associated with unemployment in adulthood, even after adjusting for intelligence, social class, and gender<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797615569001</ref>. It is also associated with lower social responsibility<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1962-04824-001</ref>, more disciplinary referrals<ref>https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/pubeco/v95y2011i11p1377-1385.html</ref>, in addition to differences in physical health, substance dependence, personal finances, and criminal offending outcomes<ref>https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1010076108</ref>. Assignment to different schooling opportunities is not significantly associated with child time preferences<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727271930091X</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Suicide</span>

Suicide is mainly associated with social isolation, such as marital status and living alone, loneliness, alienation, and belongingness<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30445391/</ref>. In terms of cross-country differences in suicide, high unemployment is positviely associated with male suicide, while income is negatively associated with male suicide up until a high threshold of income<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1069397103253708</ref>. Suicidal acts are significantly more likely to be fatal for men than for women<ref>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M19-1324</ref>. Between 1963 and 1975 the annual number of suicides in England and Wales showed a sudden and unexpected decline, inconsistent with trends in most other European countries. This appears to have been a result of the progressive removal of carbon monoxide from the public gas supply, which accounted for more than 40% of suicides in 1963. Suicide by domesic gas was essentially eliminated by 1975<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/449144</ref>.

Between 2000 and 2020, the US suicide rate exhibited an upward trend. Rising suicide rates in the US since 2000 were driven by an increase in the rates for middle-aged and older adults in the 2000s and by rising rates for younger people in the 2010s. The rise in middle-aged suicides was likely due to the great recession, while the increase in youth suicides appears to coincide with increased rates of social media usage and smartphone ownership<ref>https://www.nber.org/bh/20232/what-accounts-rise-suicide-rates-us</ref>.

The Asian economic crisis of 1997-1998 appears to be associated with a sharp increase in some but not all East/Southeast Asian countries. These increases were most closely associated with rises in unemployment<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953609000100</ref>.

The East German communist regime did not appear to increase suicide, contrary to documentation by the west. Whether it was monarchy, democracy, fascism or socialism, the frequency of suicide did not change significantly<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/26733028?seq=1</ref>.

Both being without work and adverse working conditions increase suicide risk<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20250312105141/https://sprc.org/news/unemployment-and-suicide/</ref>.

Following the 2008 economic crisis, there was a marked rise in suicide rates in European and American countries, which would translate into thousands of excess suicides<ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130917194948.htm</ref>.

The average cost of one suicide was $1,329,553. More than 97 percent of this cost was due to lost productivity. The remaining 3 percent were costs associated with medical treatment<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20180621143426/https://www.sprc.org/about-suicide/costs</ref>.

A number of studies have indicated that when lethal means are made less available or less deadly, suicide rates by that method decline, and frequently suicide rates overall decline. This has been demonstrated in a number of areas: bridge barriers, detoxification of domestic gas, pesticides, medication packaging, and others<ref>https://means-matter.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/saves-lives/</ref>.

Variation in state-level suicide rates is largely driven by rates of suicide by firearm. More than twice as many suicides by firearm occur in states with the fewest gun laws, relative to states with the most laws. Firearms are the most lethal method of suicide attempts, and about half of suicide attempts take place within 10 minutes of the current suicide thought, so having access to firearms is a suicide risk factor. The availability of firearms has been linked to suicides in a number of peer-reviewed studies<ref>https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/do-states-with-easier-access-to-guns-have-more-suicide-deaths-by-firearm/</ref>.

Social networking websites are utilized by suicidal and self-harming youth as a medium to communicate with and to seek social support from other users. Online social networking also leads to increased exposure to and engagement in self-harm behavior due to users receiving negative messages promoting self-harm, emulating self-injurious behavior of others, and adopting self-harm practices from shared videos. Greater time spent on social networking websites led to higher psychological distress, an unmet need for mental health support, poor self-rated mental health, and increased suicidal ideation<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6278213/</ref>.

Most people who have died by suicide have suffered from mental disorders, a percentage which could be at least 90%. Risk of suicide has been estimated to be 5–8% for several mental disorders, such as depression, alcoholism and schizophrenia<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6165520/</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Tattoos</span>

People with tattoos tend to be rated as less attractive, more promiscuous, and more heavy drinkers based on their appearance<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18089280/</ref>. While some stereotyping may be negative in this respect, there is a degree of accuracy to negative stereotypes about tattooed people.

People with tattoos are more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22153289/</ref>, including physical violence<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12042538/</ref>, more drinking and illicit drug consumption, higher suicidal ideation/attempts and depression<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22726901/</ref>, psychiatric disorders such as antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2333825/</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080715204734.htm</ref>, higher levels of psychopathy and schizophrenia<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1781185/</ref>, higher impulsiveness, adventurism, empathy, and neuroticism<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15119003/</ref>, and have an earlier age of first intercourse and are more sexually active<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22616886/</ref>.

Moreover, people with tattoos are more likely to have experienced childhood abuse and neglect<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35449026/</ref>, and score about 5 points lower on IQ tests<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15119003/</ref>. They also appear to die earlier than those without tattoos, possibly due to health concerns but also potentially due to higher levels of risk-taking behavior<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24926092/</ref>. Tattoos may signify something traumatic or extreme in someone's life or may signify impulsiveness in itself.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Trigger Warnings</span>

Trigger warnings have no net effect on affective responses to material being warned about nor on educational outcomes<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993791/</ref><ref>https://osf.io/qav9m/</ref>. It doesn't decrease engagement with negative material but can in fact increase engagement with material. Additionally, trigger warnings reinforce trauma survivor’s views of their trauma being central to their identity and increase anticipatory stress<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2167702620921341</ref>. This suggests that trigger warnings at best do essentially nothing and at worst have small negative effects.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Physiognomy</span>

Facial width-to-height ratio is a predictor of one's propensity for aggressive behavior<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2570531/</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Eugenics/Genetic Enhancement</span>

Anomaly (2018) defended the concept of eugenics or genetic enhancement and advocated for numerous "eugenic" policy proposals. Policy proposals include free contraception, genetic education and counseling, and incentives and penalties<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40592-018-0081-2</ref>. Jonathan Anomaly believes that states should apply as little coercion as possible to facilitate the emergence of future people with desirable traits.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Altruism and Ethics</span>

Humans routinely help others to achieve their goals, even when the helper receives no immediate benefit and the person helped is a stranger. Such altruistic behaviors exist in human children as young as 18 months in age and also exist in chimpanzees although with less robust skills and motivations<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16513986/</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Weight Loss (PROBABLY NEEDS TO GO INTO HEALTH)</span>

Obesity is associated with higher all-cause mortality<ref>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1555137</ref>. Obesity has a substantial heritability, although there is significant variability in the heritability estimate across studies<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355836/</ref>. Reduced energy diets and weight loss medications result in some weight loss outcomes, while advice-only and exercise-alone had minimal effects<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17904936/</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Delay Gratification</span>

Contrary to expert opinion based on polling, delay of gratification times have been increasing over the past 50 years, with a fifth of a standard increase in ability per decade. These correspond to secular gains in IQ seen, suggesting a possible common cause<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289620300295</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Economic Outcomes</span>

Savings propensities are about 33% heritable, and individuals are born with a persistent genetic predisposition to a specific savings behavior. Parenting has some effect on savings among younger individuals but this effect decays over time<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/679284#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref>. Lifetime income is 24% heritable in women and 54% heritable in men<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2253264</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Belief</span>

Although there has been previous research suggesting that correcting misinformation may backfire, causing people to strengthen false misconceptions rather than reduce them, more recent research suggests that by and large citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their ideological commitments<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-018-9443-y</ref><ref>https://skepticalscience.com/docs/DebunkingHandbook2020.pdf</ref>.

Although many people may have the impression that people with conspiracy beliefs are very irrational and thus won't budge to new evidence, they in fact can. Research shows that belief in conspiracy theories can be reduced through rational argumentation<ref>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01525/full</ref>. This is in spite of the fact that many people who believe in conspiracy theories are motivated to do so, due to many people holding conspiracy theories having a need to uniqueness<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314188232_Too_special_to_be_duped_Need_for_uniqueness_motivates_conspiracy_beliefs</ref>.

A 2004 meta-analysis found that there is a sleeper effect, where a discounting piece of evidence is less persuasive immediately after exposure than it is later in time. The increase in persuasion is stronger when recipients of discounting cues have higher ability or motivation to think about the message<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3100161/</ref>.

Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek or interpret evidence in ways that are partial to existing beliefs, expectations, or a hypothesis in hand<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175</ref>. This has been shown in the case of the evaluation of political arguments, where attitudinally congruent arguments are uncritically supported and evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments, which are counter-argued against<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x</ref>. The latter can be referred to as a disconfirmation bias. This can lead to attitude polarization. Whether a person's prior belief is accompanied by emotional conviction affects the magnitude and form of the disconfirmation bias<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-01782-001</ref>.

On average, people had a harder time distinguishing between real and fake news if they were generation Z, non-male, less educated, and more conservative<ref>https://news.ubc.ca/2025/04/misinformation-susceptibility-who-falls-for-fake-news/</ref>.

Some argue that misinformation is something that you can be inoculated from by teaching people to identify surface-level fingerprints such as use of emotional language to detect misinformation. However, whether a claim is true or false is independent from these “fingerprints” and instead deals with whether it corresponds to reality, it’s in the interests of misinformation communicators to avoid these fingerprints, and the most widespread and effective misinformation techniques do that, these techniques are not inherently bad, and these fingerprints can risk detecting false positives. Evidence suggests that attempts to inoculate people against misinformation in general make people more likely to rate all information as false or manipulative, and fails to translate into generalized misinformation inoculation<ref>https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/misinformation-isnt-a-contagious</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Biorealism</span>

Misc biorealism factoids:
- Parental incarceration generally has positive effects on the child through the removal of a negative role model<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3034539</ref><ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190415&from=f</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Journalists</span>

Journalists generally prefer parties with more left-wing positions<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353756955_The_Left-liberal_Skew_of_Western_Media</ref>.

Americans’ trust in media is currently very low<ref>https://news.gallup.com/poll/651977/americans-trust-media-remains-trend-low.aspx</ref>.

## Cancel Culture

The term "cancel culture" has its political roots on black Twitter, where it referred to attempts to use it to call out behavior deemed racist or offensive and put it on blast into the news. Since then, the term has expanded and has no universally agreed upon definition. In identifying how individuals define cancel culture, research has revealed ten themes that are most commonly mentioned. They are overblown disagreement, financial consequences, withdrawing support, job and visibility loss, mob punishment, rewriting history, accountability, freedom of speech, silencing opposition, and social media call out. Republicans appear to be less supportive of cancelling than democrats<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10659129241261374</ref>.

Cancel culture, through disempowering opposition, can feel collectively empowering and validating for the group feeling targeted by the individual being cancelled<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10399695/#abstract1</ref>.

Contrary to the estimates of Americans, only a minority of individuals actually engage in sanctioning behaviors often defined under the umbrella of "cancel culture". While some claim that cancelling behavior is primarily driven by personal dislike of individuals, particularly members of the other party, rather than principled disagreements, Americans tend to sanction statements that offend their ideology regardless of who says them. When presented with comparable scenarios, Democrats and Republicans appear to cancel others at similar rates. The real-world difference where Democrats cancel more may be due to them being exposed to more "cancellable" statements<ref>https://ubwp.buffalo.edu/jopblog/2025/04/01/unraveling-a-cancel-culture-dynamic-when-why-and-which-americans-sanction-offensive-speech/</ref>.

About 40% of Americans report keeping quiet and holding back their true beliefs for fear of reprisal, significantly higher than during McCarthyism when only 13% of Americans reported censorship. Nearly one in four Americans are afraid to state certain opinions for fear of losing their jobs or standings in school<ref>https://americansforprosperity.org/blog/cancel-culture-fire-survey-results/</ref>.

Cancel culture can constitute a means of norm enforcement, particularly when other forms of enforcement such as legal ones are absent or unapplicable.

However, the extremeness of the punishment means that there's few behaviors which should probably be considered cancellable which wouldn't be addressed through some other means, such as legally or otherwise.

## Mobbing

Individuals exposed to mobbing often develop trauma-related PTSD<ref>https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/4040932</ref>.

Academic mobbing is a non-violent, sophisticated ganging up behavior adopted by academics to emotionally wear a colleague down through unjustified accusation, humiliation, general harassment and emotional abuse. These are directed at the target under a veil of lies and justifications so they are hidden to others and difficult to prove. Campuses are common places for academic mobbing to occur, and is done through shunning, gossip, ridicule, bureaucratic hassles and withholding of deserved awards. Bullies use mobbing activities to hide their weaknesses and incompetence. Targets are often innovative high achievers with good integrity and principles<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4170397/</ref>.

One in 30 people is a serial bully with sociopathic traits, whose behavior profile includes compulsive lying, a Jekyll and Hyde nature, superficial charm, considerable capacity to deceive, arrested emotional development and a compulsive need to control<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4170397/</ref>.

In extreme cases, mobbing can result in suicide or murder-suicide. The targets’ position and influence in the organization is destroyed. Because the workplace has a web of social connections, targets tend to get ostracized and isolated, and colleagues shy away from the target out of fear of guilt by association. Targets exhibit profound feelings of self doubt, shame, worthlessness, humiliation, unhappiness and desperation. They become withdrawn and alienated from their colleagues, friends and sometimes families. Academic mobbing can be responsible for anxiety, depression and somatization syndrome. Target's obsessive preoccupation with the mobbing experience can have a negative impact on communication, intimacy and sex, work, parenting and household management within the family. One study estimated that 15% of suicides in Sweden were directly attributed to workplace mobbing<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4170397/</ref>.

Mobbing is rooted in the impulses we share with many other species. It is the coming to the surface, the expression in distinctly human ways, of instincts we are born with, tendencies to which we are genetically, physically inclined. This doesn’t mean that it’s inevitable or desirable, but it does mean that mobbing cannot easily be legislated out of existence, as if it were purely cultural<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/graz0701.htm</ref>.

Mobbing is best understood as a social contagion, where people surrender their independence of mind. Pooling of people’s judgments is often a step toward truth, but it is only when the judgments are independent and uninfluenced by one another. In crowds, people can be irrational in their judgments. The main perpetrators of mobbing are unlikely to ever change their minds about the target, especially when ambiguity is involved<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/takeaways240723.html</ref>.

In a typical mobbing case, apologies do not dampen but rather inflame the hostility of mobbers. Mobbers will generally either misconstrue the apology as a confession of worse wrongdoing than the target intends, or reject the apology as inadequate, insincere, misdirected or a said too late<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/takeaways240723.html</ref>.

The more an academic discipline has been influenced by postmodernism, which elevates subjectivity and puts objective truth into doubt, the more likely mobbing is to occur in it<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/takeaways240723.html</ref>.

There are a number of conditions that increase a person’s vulnerability to mobbing, that are either inside or outside the control of the target<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/unkindlyart.htm</ref>:

* Being different from most colleagues in an elemental way such as sex or race
* Being exceptionally high-achieving in teaching or research such that colleagues’ envy is aroused
* Publicly dissenting from politically incorrect ideas
* Defending a pariah on campus or the larger cultural arena

Ordinarily, targets of mobbing are scarred for life<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/unkindlyart.htm</ref>.

Checklist of 16 mobbing indicators<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/checklist.htm</ref>:

* By standard criteria of job performance, the target is at least average, probably above average.
* Rumours and gossip circulate about the target’s misdeeds: “Did you hear what she did last week?”
* The target is not invited to meetings or voted onto committees, is excluded or excludes self.
* Collective focus on a critical incident that “shows what kind of man he really is.”
* Shared conviction that the target needs some kind of formal punishment, “to be taught a lesson.”
* Unusual timing of the decision to punish, e. g., apart from the annual performance review.
* Emotion-laden, defamatory rhetoric about the target in oral and written communications.
* Formal expressions of collective negative sentiment toward the target, e. g. a vote of censure, signatures on a petition, meeting to discuss what to do about the target.
* High value on secrecy, confidentiality, and collegial solidarity among the mobbers.
* Loss of diversity of argument, so that it becomes dangerous to “speak up for”or defend the target.
* The adding up of the target’s real or imagined venial sins to make a mortal sin that cries for action.
* The target is seen as personally abhorrent, with no redeeming qualities; stigmatizing, exclusionary labels are applied.
* Disregard of established procedures, as mobbers take matters into their own hands.
* Resistance to independent, outside review of sanctions imposed on the target.
* Outraged response to any appeals for outside help the target may make.
* Mobbers’ fear of violence from target, target’s fear of violence from mobbers, or both.

## Dunbar's Number

Analysis of a dataset of twitter conversations involving 1.7 million individuals suggests that users can entertain a maximum of about 100-200 stable relationships<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022656</ref>.

Maximum network size as measured by the exchange of Christmas cards was 153.5 individuals, with a mean network size of 124.9 for those individuals explicitly contacted. Dunbar’s number of 150 is based on the relative size of human’s neocortexes relative to other primates and extrapolating the social group size of those primates to humans indexed by neocortex size. This implies there may be cognitive constraints on network size<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26189988/</ref>.

The number of friends a person has reliably predicts grey matter density in areas of the brain implicated in social perception and associative memory, suggesting that brain structure heavily contributes to the way in which social cognition operates in humans<ref>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2011.1959</ref>.

There exists layers of friend circles, where the emotionally closest circles are the smallest, and the least emotionally close circles are the largest<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301879177_Calling_Dunbar's_Numbers</ref><ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1634986/</ref>.

The size of online egocentric social networks, indexed as the number of Facebook friends, is similar to that of offline face-to-face networks, suggesting a cognitive constraint on the size of social networks that even communications advantages of online media are unable to overcome<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26909163/</ref>.

## Post-Truth

Fake news spreads significantly more rapidly on Twitter than real news does. This is not due to bots that are programmed to disseminate inaccurate stories, but because of people retweeting false news items. Fake news stories are 70 percent more likely to be retweeted than true stories are. It also takes true stories about six times as long to reach 1500 people as it does for false stories to reach the same number of people<ref>https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-twitter-false-news-travels-faster-true-stories-0308</ref>.

The illusory truth effect occurs when prior exposure to fake news increases the chance of it being perceived as accurate. A study found that even a single exposure to a fake news headline increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy. However, prior exposure does not impact entirely implausible statements, like the earth being a perfect square. Although extreme implausibility is a boundary condition of the illusory truth effect, only a small degree of potential plausibility is sufficient for repetition to increase perceived accuracy<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317069544_Prior_Exposure_Increases_Perceived_Accuracy_of_Fake_News</ref>.

Trust in media, particularly news media, has become fragile, as there is a drop in trust in media. Algorithmic news recommender systems, while crucial in helping news consumers find and filter relevant information, have been identified as playing a key role in lower trust through their profit-driven logic, privacy and surveillance issues, lack of diversity, bias, contribution to the spread of misinformation and black-box operations. Lack of trust contributes to uncertainty regarding what you know and why<ref>https://www.algepi.com/how-to-understand-trust-in-news-recommender-systems/</ref>.

During the 2016 US presidential campaign, independent fact checker PolitiFact judged 70% of all statements by Trump to be false or mostly false, and 26% of Hillary Clinton’s. Research suggested that when people, including Trump supporters, received corrections of false claims Trump made, they believed the statements less. However, for Trump supporters there was no association between the extent to which they shifted their belief when a statement was corrected and their feelings for President Trump or their intention to vote for him<ref>https://cssn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beyond-Misinformation-Understanding-and-Coping-with-the-Post-Truth-Era-Stephan-Lewandowsky.pdf</ref>.


Misinformation doesn’t simply misinform, but can actually cause people to stop believing in facts altogether. People who are presented with both a persuasive fact and a related piece of misinformation experienced no change in belief overall, and hence the misinformation cancelled out the fact. Research suggests that corrections of misinformation are rarely fully effective: that is, despite being corrected, and despite acknowledging the correction, people by and large continue to rely at least partially on information they know to be false. This is known as the continued-influence effect. In some circumstances, when the correction challenges people’s worldviews, belief in false information may ironically even increase<ref>https://cssn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beyond-Misinformation-Understanding-and-Coping-with-the-Post-Truth-Era-Stephan-Lewandowsky.pdf</ref>.

Corrections are effective only when they do not directly challenge people’s worldviews (can  be done by affirming the self-worth of recipients or by making the correction more persuasive by graphical means), and when they explain why the misinformation was was disseminated in the first place or they must provide an alternative explanation of the relevant event. While misinformation is an important part of the post-truth malaise, post-truth cannot be reduced to misinformation. Post-truth must be understood as the creation of an alternative epistemology that does not conform to conventional standards of evidentiary support<ref>https://cssn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beyond-Misinformation-Understanding-and-Coping-with-the-Post-Truth-Era-Stephan-Lewandowsky.pdf</ref>.

Trends supporting the emergence of a post-truth world<ref>https://cssn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beyond-Misinformation-Understanding-and-Coping-with-the-Post-Truth-Era-Stephan-Lewandowsky.pdf</ref>:
* Decline in social capital and shifting values as a result, where people feel less trust and less of a sense of obligation to others
* Growing inequality, which increases political polarization. This appears to not be so much both parties drifting apart, but the republican party becoming so much more right-wing over time
* Declining trust in science
* Evolution of the media landscape. Number of media companies has increased greatly, flexibility and fractionalization offered by social media allows people to create echo chambers, also leads to heterogeneity among audiences in the extent to which they are misinformed about important issues. Online political discourse has become extremely uncivil, in part as a result of the psychological distance and associated deindividuation between online participants.

One role of post-truth statements is to distract the public from unwanted information or potentially unpopular policy actions There is also an increasing fluidity of allegiances: not only do facts not matter, but anyone can be turned into a friend or foe, even if it implies a departure from long-standing beliefs and principles<ref>https://cssn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Beyond-Misinformation-Understanding-and-Coping-with-the-Post-Truth-Era-Stephan-Lewandowsky.pdf</ref>.

## Epigenetics

Epigenetics examines how cells control gene activity without changing the DNA sequence. Epigenetic changes are modifications to DNA that regulate whether genes are turned on or off. The epigenome is all of the modifications that regulate the activity/expression of the genes within the complete set of DNA in a cell/genome. Environmental influences, such as a person’s diet and exposure to pollutants can impact the epigenome. Epigenetic modifications can be maintained from cell to cell as cells divide and in some cases can be inherited through the generations<ref>https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/howgeneswork/epigenome/</ref>.

Epigenetic effects contribute to depression. Environmental stressors such as childhood adversity and recent life stress are associated with major depression (MDD), an effect which is mediated by a number of epigenetic modifications<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01519-z?error=cookies_not_supported&code=301d0659-aa9c-4a77-b5bc-110c8ed6a658</ref>.

Prenatal exposure to famine can cause epigenetic changes in a child that can last many decades<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2579375/</ref>.

Evidence for intergenerational transmission of stress in humans is supported empirically by data from holocaust survivor offspring cohorts and other populations<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2015247?error=cookies_not_supported&code=ee1ed8e1-bb26-413e-a85c-3d3f8cc3d0bd</ref>.

Epigenetic inheritance may account for a significant portion of “missing heritability” in GWAS studies<ref>https://humgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40246-015-0041-3</ref>.

## Crime vs Thought

Liberals are more likely to feel comfortable sharing their political beliefs, while conservatives are most likely to self-censor. Democrats are more likely to favor banning hate speech, saying offensive or insulting things about a group more than republicans, even when it’s about things that republicans favor such as the military and police<ref>https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/state-free-speech-tolerance-america#overview</ref>.

Leftists are more concerned with avoiding offending others when they speak<ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/05/05/4-political-correctness-and-offensive-speech/</ref>.

Liberals are cognitively speaking more flexible and tolerant of complexity and novelty, while conservatives are more rigid, more resistant to change and prefer clear answers. Liberals solve significantly more problems through insight instead of a step-by-step analytic fashion<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4869693/</ref>.

Conservatives tend to show more intolerance to groups perceived as more liberal, while liberals tend to show more intolerance to groups perceived as more conservative<ref>https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/the-ideological-conflict-hypothesis-intolerance-among-both-libera</ref>.

Conservatives had less favorable impressions than liberals of groups that were identified as liberal (e.g., African Americans, homosexuals), but more favorable impressions than liberals of groups identified as conservative (e.g., Christian fundamentalists, businesspeople). This suggests that prejudice exists across the ideological spectrum<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797612447820?icid=int.sj-abstract.citing-articles.137</ref>.

In reacting to victims of crimes, liberals tend to have a reparative mindset that directly addresses the needs and concerns of victims, while conservative responses are at least equally reflective of a punitive mindset that addresses victim harm through offender punishment<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228281541_Political_Ideology_and_Reactions_to_Crime_Victims_Preferences_for_Restorative_and_Punitive_Responses#:~:text=,associated%20with%20decreased%20confidence%20and</ref>.

Right-wing authoritarianism predicts both the extent to which people worry about social threats and the extent to which they support harsh punitive measures<ref>https://www.academia.edu/14032546/Authority_and_punishment_on_the_ideological_basis_of_punitive_attitudes_towards_criminals</ref>.

Liberals tend to be more empathetic than conservatives according to self reporting. This is corroborated by higher neural empathy responses in liberals compared to conservatives<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10281241/</ref>.

Harm and Fairness are considered individualizing because they emphasize the protection of individual wellbeing and rights. Authority, Loyalty, and Purity are considered binding because they emphasize duty, interdependence, tradition, and adherence to cultural and religious practices. Endorsement of group-oriented moral concerns was associated with more punitive and conservative attitudes, while endorsement of individual-oriented moral concerns was associated with less punitive and less conservative attitudes<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28150974/</ref>.

## Impact of Nationalism

National pride is correlated with greater personal well-being, but civic nationalists are on the whole happier than ethnic nationalists<ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/12/111209171944.htm</ref>.

Nationalism can improve social cohesion but can also increase protectionism and intolerance. There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between nationalism and government effectiveness, with most countries having a higher than optimal level of nationalism. Nationalism may also mitigate the effects of ethnic heterogeneity in former colonies through creating a new identity where there wasn’t one prior<ref>https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jcecon/v39y2011i3p431-451.html</ref>.

Group-based relative deprivation in New Zealand was found to be negatively associated with well-being. However, it was associated with higher nationalism which was itself associated with higher well-being. This suggests that endorsing beliefs about national identity or superiority can help a dominant ethnic group cope with perceiving that their group is deprived<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pops.12563</ref>.

## Evolution of Morality

Morality’s defining traits, according to Frans de Waal, which include empathy, reciprocity, reconciliation and consolation, can be seen in many animals, most particularly in primates. Empathy is an automatic response seen in human infants, dogs and apes. This most likely originates with parents' care but extends beyond parent-child relationships. Both chimps and capuchins will work with other members of their groups to reach a common goal even if there is no immediate reward. In order to preserve important relationships, chimps will engage in friendly reunions after a conflict, similar to the way a married couple or good friends might reconcile after a conflict. Consolation, defined as friendly contact and reassurance by an uninvolved third party after a conflict, is a behavior seen only in great apes and humans<ref>https://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/2007/April/April%2016/DeWaal.htm</ref>.

Although the particulars have substantial cultural variation, a sense of fairness appears to be a human universal that has been shown to prevail in a wide variety of circumstances. Many highly cooperative nonhuman species also appear to have an aversion to inequity. The brown capuchin monkey responds negatively to unequal reward distribution in exchanges with a human experimenter. Monkeys refused to participate if they witnessed a conspecific obtain a more attractive reward for equal effort, an effect amplified if the partner received such a reward without any effort at all. This supports the notion of an early evolutionary origin of inequity aversion<ref>https://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/publications/articles/Brosnan_deWaal_2003.pdf</ref>.

In the ultimatum game, a proposer decides how much of $10 to give a responder, and the responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer. If the responder accepts, the players split the money in the way the proposer suggested. If the responder rejects, neither player gets any money. This happens only once and the players know this<ref>https://fte.org/teachers/teacher-resources/lesson-plans/is-capitalism-good-for-the-poor-2/the-ultimatum-game-appendix-1/</ref>.

Game theory predicts that since both parties know the rejection of the offer results in neither receiving any money, the proposer will offer the smallest possible amount and the responder will always accept. However, in practice proposers generally offer more than the minimum and responders frequently reject low offers, choosing to receive nothing. The rejection of the selfishness axiom exists cross-culturally, as a study of 15 small indigenous societies on 4 continents found significant cultural group differences in behavior but none held to the selfishness axiom. Some economists try to model this by including “other-regarding” preferences, where players have an innate conception of fairness<ref>https://fte.org/teachers/teacher-resources/lesson-plans/is-capitalism-good-for-the-poor-2/the-ultimatum-game-appendix-1/</ref>.

In market economies, people’s concern for reputation modifies the predicted materially self-interested behavior that often fails to appear in ultimatum games. There is a correlation between more equal splits and markets which holds in both developed countries as well as indigenous subsistence economies. Thus, there is a positive relationship between market integration and offer size in the ultimatum game, which is the opposite of what many would expect who instead believe that markets make people selfish<ref>https://fte.org/teachers/teacher-resources/lesson-plans/is-capitalism-good-for-the-poor-2/the-ultimatum-game-appendix-1/</ref>.

Research across 21 nations shows that the propensity for ecological threat correlates with the short (S) allele frequency in the 5-HTTLPR, allelic frequency in the 5-HTTLPR and vulnerability to ecological threat both correlate with cultural tightness-looseness, susceptibility to ecological threat predicts tightness–looseness via the mediation of S allele carriers, and frequency of S allele carriers predicts justifiability of morally relevant behavior via tightness–looseness. Hence, there is an interplay between environmental, genetic, and cultural factors underlying contemporary differences in social behavior<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40167-013-0009-x</ref>.

Human societies exist as they do today because of group members enforcing moral behaviors and social rules on each other. Social punishment ultimately shaped the group’s survival, which led to advantageous evolutionary strategies that foster conscience and altruism. Acts such as cheating, stealing or killing were dealt with systematically early in the dawn of Homo Sapiens through the use of shame, ostracism or other punitive actions, which has led to an adaptive genetic inheritance of “social self controls”. The biological advantage of imposing rules of behavior in the first place is that groups survive better than single individuals. This social selection is certainly not as strong as sexual selection or natural selection is, as countless people today violate social norms nonetheless. One possible reason is that it has not been around long enough<ref>https://dwz.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/114/2016/11/MoralBookReview.pdf</ref>.

Some elements of morality clearly evolved, but the specifics are unclear, which underlines the implications that ecopsych people take when using this to discuss moral philosophy. A small body of evidence suggests that normative cognition, the ability to grasp and apply norms, evolved. This provides weak evidence that moral cognition evolved. Some argue that if morality evolved then it is undermined in its legitimacy, but if normative cognition evolved in general then under that same logic other norms such as epistemic norms would then be equally undermined<ref>https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/MacheryMallonEvolutionMorality2010.pdf</ref>.

The Moral Foundations Theory attempts to explain why despite vast differences across cultures, morality often has shared themes and similarities across populations by suggesting there are several innate psychological systems at the core of our “intuitive ethics”. The original framework identified five foundations that were strongly supported by evidence across various cultures<ref>https://moralfoundations.org/</ref>:
- Care: Comes from ability to feel and dislike pain of others, underlies virtues of kindness, gentleness and nurturance
- Fairness: Comes from reciprocal altruism, underlies virtues of justice and rights. 
- Loyalty: Active when people feel attached to coalitions, underlies patriotism and self-sacrifice for the group
- Authority: Deference to prestigious authority figures and respect for traditions
- Purity: Underlies idea that the body is a temple that can be desecrated by immoral activities and contaminants, underlies self-discipline, self-improvement, naturalness and spirituality

Fairness was later split into equality and proportionality, which suggests six foundations. Other possible foundations may be liberty, honor and ownership<ref>https://moralfoundations.org/</ref>.

Kohlberg’s theory of moral development consists of six stages arranged sequentially in successive tiers of complexity. The first two are in level 1, the preconventional level; the next two are in level 2, the conventional level; and the last two are in level 3, the postconventional level<ref>https://www.britannica.com/science/Lawrence-Kohlbergs-stages-of-moral-development</ref>.

At the preconventional level, morality is externally controlled<ref>https://www.britannica.com/science/Lawrence-Kohlbergs-stages-of-moral-development</ref>.
- Stage 1: Punishment/obedience orientation - Behaviour is determined by consequences. The individual will obey in order to avoid punishment.
- Stage 2: Instrumental purpose orientation - Behaviour is determined again by consequences. The individual focuses on receiving rewards or satisfying personal needs.

At the conventional level, conformity to social rules remains important, but the emphasis shifts from self-interest to relationships with other people and social systems<ref>https://www.britannica.com/science/Lawrence-Kohlbergs-stages-of-moral-development</ref>.
- Stage 3: Good Boy/Nice Girl orientation - Behaviour is determined by social approval. The individual wants to maintain or win the affection and approval of others by being a “good person.”
- Stage 4: Law and order orientation - Social rules and laws determine behaviour. The individual now takes into consideration a larger perspective, that of societal laws. Moral decision making becomes more than consideration of close ties to others. The individual believes that rules and laws maintain social order that is worth preserving.

At the postconventional or principled level, the individual moves beyond the perspective of their own society, and defines morality in terms of abstract principles and values that apply to all situations and societies. The individual attempts to take the perspective of all individuals<ref>https://www.britannica.com/science/Lawrence-Kohlbergs-stages-of-moral-development</ref>.
- Stage 5: Social contract orientation - Individual rights determine behaviour. The individual views laws and rules as flexible tools for improving human purposes. That is, given the right situation, there are exceptions to rules. When laws are not consistent with individual rights and the interests of the majority, they do not bring about good for people and alternatives should be considered.
- Stage 6: Universal ethical principle orientation - According to Kohlberg, this is the highest stage of functioning. However, he claimed that some individuals will never reach this level. At this stage, the appropriate action is determined by one’s self-chosen ethical principles of conscience. These principles are abstract and universal in application. This type of reasoning involves taking the perspective of every person or group that could potentially be affected by the decision.

Data shows that older individuals tend to use higher stages of moral reasoning when compared with younger individuals, and there is “upward” progression in accordance with the theoretical order of stages. Studies have revealed that comprehension of the stages is cumulative (i.e. someone at stage 4 understands the lower stages but not necessarily the higher stages)<ref>https://www.britannica.com/science/Lawrence-Kohlbergs-stages-of-moral-development</ref>.

Kohlberg’s scheme should not be interpreted in terms of increasing degrees of moral maturity, but rather in terms of personality style and political preferences<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cui-bono/202506/do-liberals-protest-more-than-conservatives</ref>.

Persons whose moral appraisals are grounded on considerations which regularly transcend the dictates of law and custom may be unconventional, liberal, and progressive; however, they may also be capricious, undependable, and anticonforming. On the other hand, persons whose moral judgments are guided by rational and legal considerations are often thoughtful, considerate, and honest; yet, they may also be conventional and overconforming. They have a strong need for structure and order and tend to gravitate to positions where support of rules of conduct is viewed as positive behavior. Low scorers, on the other hand, often seem to delight in changing the "system." Thus, both high and low scorers on the test possess unique virtues and drawbacks, and an effective society undoubtedly requires both kinds of persons; that is, high scorers to provide stability and order, low scorers to provide the stimulus for evolution and change<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0030095</ref>.

## Autism and Belief

Many autistic people seem to be less susceptible to cognitive biases, and are thus better able to make judgments and reach decisions in a more rational manner. Some studies have found that autistic individuals are less influenced by the framing of a choice when deciding between options (framing effect). Autistic individuals have a reduced optimism bias, the bias where people tend to neglect information containing undesirable news but adjust their outlook in response to desirable news. Autistic individuals integrate information in a more objective and unbiased manner than is typical. Autistic people are less likely to fall for the sunk cost fallacy. Autistic individuals are more rational in their judgments about people. They are as likely as neurotypical individuals to show an understanding of race and gender stereotypes, but have lower implicit bias levels, which could be seen as a form of enhanced rationality<ref>https://psyche.co/ideas/autistic-people-challenge-preconceived-ideas-about-rationality</ref>.

Subcortical brain shape maleness is positively associated with autistic symptoms. This appears to be a function of the size, as after adjusting for size there is no difference in brain maleness between ASD and non-ASD individuals. This provides evidence in support of the extreme male brain hypothesis of autism. ASD is four times more common in males than females, and some autistic traits are associated with male-typical behavior. For example, men tend to score lower on empathy tasks, and adults with ASD irrespective of sex score the lowest. Men score on average higher than women on an attention-to-detail task, while individuals with ASD score the highest. Women tended to be empathizing, while men tended to be systematizing. The majority of males and females with autistic symptoms were systematizing<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8328919/</ref>.

Children with autism are less likely to conform to the majority in the line judgment task compared to children without autism. Autistic traits negatively correlate with likelihood to conform in the typically developing group<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24126871/</ref>.

People tend to act more prosocially when they know they are watched by others due to social reputation concerns. However, high-functioning autistic people are not influenced by the presence or absence of an observer, suggesting that people with autism lack the ability to take into consideration what others think of them<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3198313/</ref>.

Adults with asperger’s syndrome were no more or less likely to conform on average in Asch’s line judgment task, but were significantly more likely to adopt a consistently conforming or nonconforming strategy<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8040221/</ref>.

ASD children perform similarly in deception tasks if both groups have lower social components, but as the social components increase ASD children perform relatively worse, although perform the same on an absolute level<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311698028_Trust_and_Deception_in_Children_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders_A_Social_Learning_Perspective</ref>.

Although young school-aged ASD children did not blindly trust any information provided by the unfamiliar adult, they appeared to be more trusting in the adult informant than did their age- and ability-matched TD children<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022096513000994</ref>.

ASD people are less able to distinguish truth from lies, which increases risks of being manipulated<ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180522114817.htm</ref>.

## Personality Cults

A cult of personality is a deliberately created system of art, symbolism and ritual centered on the institutionalized quasi-religious glorification of a specific individual. Since the 20th century, cult of personality has been most often used to refer to charismatic leader cults, a type of personality cult which is based on a political leader and designed to enforce their power, magnify their ideology, and legitimize the rule of the government associated with them. In the 20th century the rise of mass media led to the establishment and flourishing of many personality cults. Autocratic and repressive regimes sought to use these cults of personality to legitimize their power. Some cults were centered on figures who had already attained power or prestige, others lent credence to new political ideologies<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/cult-of-personality</ref>.

While these were aimed at providing legitimacy to governments, the ultimate effect was to associate the entire cult of personality with the atrocities committed by these regimes. Increasingly, accusing a leader of being the subject of a cult of personality is a way to question that leader’s authority. Still, these persist in the 21st century<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/cult-of-personality</ref>.

Only two characteristics of a cult of personality have been identified by all scholars. First, it is defined by a quasi-ubiquitous praise, manifested through eulogistic articles in mass media and adulatory public parades. Second, the adulation of the leader is not entirely sincere, but largely coerced through employing the state apparatus in the organization of the named parades<ref>https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/3f2fb7a8-c5f6-47f1-8560-d51dad76e57e/content</ref>.

## Neoteny

The human self-domestication hypothesis suggests that humans evolved to be friendlier and more cooperative by selecting their companions depending on their behavior. There are genetic similarities between humans and domesticated animals in their genes. There is evidence to suggest that modern humans, due to genetic differences affecting neural crest cells, have more prosocial cognition and a retracted face relative to other extinct humans in the course of our evolution. This suggests that the self-domestication hypothesis is true<ref>https://phys.org/news/2019-12-experimental-genetic-evidence-human-self-domestication.html</ref>.

Human childhood is uniquely prolonged among primates and mammals. While most mammals become self-sufficient within months or a few years, humans require over a decade. This is an adaptation rooted in life history theory, where in humans a significant portion of early life energy is devoted to brain development rather than physical growth or early reproduction. Abilities such as problem-solving, language and cultural transmission cannot be inherited genetically alone, and must be taught through extended periods of learning and interaction. Humans also exhibit secondary altriciality, meaning that even at birth infants are significantly more helpless than those of other species. This evolved as a tradeoff due to bipedalism and the limitations of the human birth canal<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/raising-resilient-children/202505/why-kids-take-so-long-to-grow-up</ref>.

There is a significant number of genes showing neotenic expression in humans compared to chimps and rhesus macaques, suggesting that in some regions of the brain humans are developmentally delayed. Humans, having delayed gray matter volume maturation, may as a result have an extended period of neuronal plasticity associated with active learning, providing humans with additional time to acquire knowledge and skills. Gene expression is delayed in humans regarding a number of neurological traits/features<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2659716/</ref>.

In humans, brain development is retarded compared with other primates, especially in some association areas. Neurons in these areas remain structurally immature throughout their lifespans and show an increase in the expression of the genes which deal with metabolism and the activity and synaptic plasticity in adulthood. The retention of juvenile features in some adult neurons has occurred in areas related to episodic memory, planning and social navigation. The increase in aerobic metabolism in these neurons may lead however to higher levels of oxidative stress, thus favoring the development of neurodegenerative diseases which are exclusive, or almost exclusive, to humans, such as Alzheimer's disease<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.21225</ref>.

From the middle pleistocene to recent times, there has been craniofacial feminization in homo sapiens (reduction in average brow ridge projection and shortening of the upper facial skeleton). This reflects changes in average androgen reactivity (lower levels of adult circulating testosterone or reduced androgen receptor densities), which in turn affect the evolution of enhanced social tolerance. This coincides with the past 200,000 years of human cultural evolution witnessing the persistent establishment of behaviors involving innovation, planning depth, and abstract and symbolic thought, or what has been called “behavioral modernity”<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271799237_Craniofacial_Feminization_Social_Tolerance_and_the_Origins_of_Behavioral_Modernity</ref>.

There is some evidence to suggest that humans also have become genetically more oriented towards self control as they evolved, which might also help to explain higher prosociality<ref>https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00134/full</ref>.

## Activism

Economic affluence, state capacity, women as a percentage of the total labor force and left corporatism (left party control and higher neocorporatism) contribute to greater aggregate protest potential. Ethnic grievances stemming from economic discrimination and percentage of protestants also contribute positively while language dominance suppresses protest potential<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/20628335?seq=1</ref>.

Mass political protests have increased globally by an annual average of 11.5 percent between 2009 and 2019. The size and frequency of recent protests are unprecedented historically, eclipsing historical examples of eras of mass protest. Common grievances overwhelmingly center on perceptions of ineffective governance and corruption. Protests have resulted in a broad range of outcomes, ranging from regime change and political accommodation to protracted political violence with many casualties. Factors that could increase the rate of protest include slowing global economic growth, worsening effects of climate change, and foreign meddling in internal politics via disinformation and other tactics<ref>https://www.csis.org/analysis/age-mass-protests-understanding-escalating-global-trend</ref>.

## Hyperconnectivity

There is a small positive association between social media use, depression, and anxiety<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39242043/</ref>.

However, one study which attempts to quantify the percentage of variance in adolescent well-being explained by technology use suggests technology use explains at least 0.4% of it<ref>https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2019-01-14-technology-use-explains-most-04-adolescent-wellbeing-new-study-finds</ref>.

Social media is associated with increased political participation and information consumption, which is likely to be beneficial for democracy. However, other associations such as declining political trust, increased populism and increased polarization are more likely to harm democracy. The beneficial effects tend to be observed in autocracies and emerging democracies while the detriments are more pronounced in established democracies<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01460-1?error=cookies_not_supported&code=b81c66cf-9230-4f01-a69a-25df089ca34b</ref>.

## Intelligence cont 1

A meta-analysis of studies amounting to a total of 280 pairs of identical twins reared apart implies a heritability of IQ of 0.83, or a 95% confidence interval of 0.74-0.91<ref>https://www.sebjenseb.net/p/we-now-have-280-pairs-of-identical?utm_source=publication-search</ref>.

About 6% of those with a visuo-spatial IQ in the 99th percentile become inventors, compared to only about 1% of those at the 50th percentile. Each percentile increases the probability of becoming an inventor by an exponential amount<ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/aghion/files/social_origins_and_iq_of_inventors.pdf</ref>.

Across an extensive number of domains, the vast majority of American extraordinary achievers attended one of an “elite 34” colleges/universities out of the roughly 4000 in the US, with a significant proportion or a majority in some cases attending Harvard or other ivy league universities. This indicates that the most successful and influential Americans come from a very narrow range of elite educational backgrounds<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-03547-8</ref>.

Cognitive processing speed and cognitive processing accuracy are different from one another genetically and also neurologically speaking<ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52222-8</ref>.

## Norms

Tipping points in social convention have been found in more generalized settings, with the size of the critical mass required ranging from 10-40%<ref>https://www.asc.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2021-03/Experimental%20evidence%20for%20tipping%20points%20in%20social%20convention.pdf</ref>.

## Population Cycles

The world population is expected to peak in 2084 at 10.3 billion<ref>https://ourworldindata.org/un-population-2024-revision</ref>.

The demographic transition is a model that explains why countries go through a period of rapid population growth. It is a sequence of five stages<ref>https://ourworldindata.org/demographic-transition</ref>:
- Stage 1 - high mortality and birth rates - Little to no population growth
- Stage 2 - Mortality falls but birth rates still high - Leads to rapid population growth.
- Stage 3 - Low mortality and birth rates begin to fall - The birth rate starts to drop which leads to lower population growth. This is because when the mortality of children is not as high as it once was, parents adapt to the healthier environment and choose to have fewer children. The economy undergoes structural changes that make children less economically valuable, and as women gain more power within society and partnerships, they tend to on average have fewer children than before.
- Stage 4 - Mortality and birth rates are low
- Stage 5 - Uncertain. The population may rise or fall again.
