**<u>Summary</u>**

Race is one of the most taboo yet most extensively discussed topics in the political world. I believe this comes down to the fact that in highly industrialized societies with populations that exceed Dunbar's number by many orders of magnitude, race becomes the most salient way to distinguish groups of people by, whereas in times past it would have been family or local tribes. In political discourse, racial inequalities have become the obsession of many, leading to the creation of oppression narratives and attempts to rectify such inequalities in various ways. Different countries around the world and throughout history have approached race in varying ways from a political perspective.

In order to understand race properly, it is crucial to understand race on a descriptive level. Race is not merely comprised of physical differences, but also psychological ones which are all a product of differing evolutionary histories of human populations. I demonstrate why these differences provide a better explanation for existing inequalities we see in places such as the United States in terms of crime, economics, and more compared to contemporary oppression narratives. Thus, policies such as affirmative action which aim to rectify these disparities on the grounds that they are due to discrimination are ill-conceived. I also discuss ethnocentrism and how it is evolutionarily natural to some degree, highlighting its societal implications and where it is more or less important.

I also examine various narratives and terms used in the discourse on race, including "racism", "reverse racism", "white privilege", and more. I unpack these terms and explain why we should reject much of the way current discourse on race is currently happening. Terms such as racism should be retired by those wanting to have honest and mature dicussions on race in favor of more specific terminology which doesn't lump a large number of behaviors and beliefs into one term with such social weight.

Politically speaking, I advocate for a broadly process-oriented polyethnic model, where there is anti-discrimination legislation present in public life which prevents unfair taste-based discrimination from occurring, undermining human potential. While geographically/locatioally people would be integrated to some degree, this system would still allow for race-based freedom of association in who lives near who and in forming groups to some degree. Immigration would still occur. In short, my views would not be significantly different from how many western countries already deal with race, just with a change in the culture and political organization away from trying to make outcomes equal when it is not possible or desirable to do so.

Due to taking a biological and mechanistic approach to discussing race, this page is extremely controversial. Much of what I discuss here would be impolite to discuss in such a blunt way in casual conversation, and it should probably remain so to some degree. I am motivated first and foremost by a desire to know what is true, and this requires an honest examination of the taboo. It is crucial to understand what is true about race if we want to create societies where everyone prospers.

## The Ethics of Investigating Race and Racial Differences

There is an extremely large taboo against looking at issues surrounding race from a biological perspective. A recent study by researchers investigating the comparative taboo of various topics found that the issue of a genetic relationship between race and intelligence was a more taboo topic than issues such as incest and pedophilia<ref>Pesta, B., Kirkegaard, E. O. W., & Bronski, J. (2024). Is research on the genetics of race / IQ gaps “Mythically taboo?” OpenPsych. https://doi.org/10.26775/op.2024.04.15</ref>, in that people were more willing to support censorship of such issues. Much of the strong aversion exhibited by many regarding this topic comes from the fear that such investigation will ultimately lead to a legitimization of racial prejudice, or claims that one group is superior to another. Admittedly, dividing people into races and implying that they may have differing characteristics is oftentimes a necessary condition by which oppression or claims of superiority can occur. However, that does not mean that suggesting that groups exist and have differing characteristics ultimately legitimates said thing. There are numerous examples in the context of people's everyday lives in which acknowledging differences does not lead or legitimate oppression or claims of superiority:

- Individuals differ from one another on a variety of physical and psychological metrics. In many cases these are heritable, and so there exist people who are genetically stronger, fitter, more sociable, more industrious, and more intelligent than others. And yet we do not see people judging one another on those bases, nor do we see people claim that they are superior to others. Even if you take two individuals who are identical in every way, except that one is significantly more intelligent than the other, no one would make a judgment that one of the two people is superior to the other, or that the other person should be oppressed in some way.

- Families also differ from one another on a variety of physical and psychological metrics. Moreover, within our society we have went even further and view it as acceptable to have biases in favor of our own family. Family gatherings, which exist solely on the basis of a crude ethnocentrism and attraction to genetic similarity are an extremely common and normalized behavior within modern societies. And yet we do not see in spite of this any claims that either some families are superior to other families, nor do we see families justify oppressing other families. We see the existence of families and even the natural ingroup preference of families as normal and acceptable, and not something which inevitably leads to division and oppression.

- These two dimensions of human existence provide an amazing heuristic for analyzing racial dynamics. Whenever one is asking the ethics of a certain proposition, one should always examine whether it would be justifiable on an individual or familial level. If it is not justifiable on either basis, it is probably unjust. If it is on either or both bases, it at least may be justifiable.

But this only suggests that the investigation of races and racial differences does not necessarily lead to oppression and claims of superiority. It says nothing about the positive benefits. There are a number of positive benefits which could be derived from investigating groups and group differences:

- Some see the discovery of truth as something inherently valuable due to the satisfaction associated with its attainment, so there could be some value derived simply from finding answers.

- Understanding racial groups and differences between races can help us better understand the nature of genetics. Seeing the origins of racial differences which may be genetic can have spillover effects into other areas of population genetics, whether it be on an individual or sex-based level in humans, or looking at the origins of traits of non-human organisms.

- It can increase empathy for others. Schneider et al. (2018) found that genetic attributions of behavior were associated with higher and not lower levels of tolerance of vulnerable populations and were not associated with unseemly racial attitudes<ref>Schneider, S. P., Smith, K. B., & Hibbing, J. R. (2018). Genetic attributions: sign of intolerance or acceptance? The Journal of Politics, 80(3), 1023–1027. https://doi.org/10.1086/696860</ref>. Seeing people's behavior as mechanistic can help us increase our empathy for others as it makes behaviors appear less based on agency and more unintentional at worst.

- It can undermine historically harmful oppression narratives, decreasing division. Historically, much of the basis for antisemitism was the attribution of Jewish success in various societies to immoral behaviors of Jews. A genetic attribution for Jewish success may actually decrease some of the resentment that has festered in many societies, because it may imply that Jews being disproportionately successful is natural as opposed to being caused by immoral behavior on the part of Jews.

None of this should be used as a case to lie about pieces of information should they appear to make people feel good. That being said, these arguments demonstrate that the acknowledgement of groups and group differences does not have to be something to legitimate oppression and racial superiority claims, and in many cases can be the exact opposite.

### A Note on Risks of Racial Violence

Because the concern to the public of increased tensions, violence, or genocide arising from talking about race differences, an extended discussion on this issue must be had. Of course, I do not believe that any discussion of the biological nature of race and racial differences should justify such things, but I think a more directly historical perspective should help to address the concerns that may nonetheless pop up.

One of the main causes of genocide that has been identified is an "ideology of superiority", which many argue will naturally arise when talking about racial differences. While this has already been argued to be a dubious assumption at best, it should be noted that an ideological of superiority is not sufficient to actually explain why genocides have occurred<ref>https://www.academia.edu/24197334/The_Causes_of_Genocide</ref>. Intuitively, this can be explained when, again, accounting for the reality that individuals and families differ on the identical traits that races do without creating immense conflict. But even if one views their group as superior to another, this does not imply any hostility to that other group whatsoever. Many humans view themselves as superior to various species of animals, such as cattle, without exhibiting any ill will towards those species.

What actually does appear to drive political violence and genocide is instead a belief in being victimized by another group. In the United States, perceived victimhood has been shown to be positively correlated with support for political violence among Democrats and Republicans<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375682741_Perceived_victimhood_shapes_support_for_interpartisan_political_violence_in_the_United_States</ref>. A consistent theme throughout many genocides is the scapegoating of a particular group of people for the plight of a society<ref>https://www.beyondintractability.org/special/genocide-causes-of-genocide#:~:text=</ref>. This actually legitimizes violence because it implies an entity which is actively being hostile to one's ingroup. Violence can then be seen as defensive rather than offensive in nature, increasing people's moral willingness to engage in it. Conspiratorial scapegoating is common to well-documented cases of genocide throughout history, including the Rwandan genocide<ref>https://humanrights.ca/story/what-led-genocide-against-tutsi-rwanda</ref>, the Armenian genocide, and the Holocaust<ref>https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/antisemitism</ref>.

Many who reject the notion of biological racial differences continuously point out disparities that exist today between groups and attribute it to some form of race-based oppression. This, while obviously not as extreme as the scapegoating exhibited in many genocides historically, falls more in line with the underlying direct causes of genocide than any honest discussion of racial differences does, which generally attempts to explain existing disparities and refute oppression narratives rather than perpetuating them. I therefore assert that discussing racial differences may, if anything, decrease conflict between groups.

## Classifying Racial Groups

The first issue which should be examined is the degree to which racial classifications are themselves legitimate. The first objection academics often give to those studying group differences is that racial groups are simply arbitrary, and thus that it is useless to study race as a category. Oftentimes, this is done with an appeal to a supposed academic consensus amongst those who study race, who universally tend to reject race as a biological category. Race is said to be a social construct, and human population differentiation is said to exist amongst a gradient as opposed to discrete categories.

Oftentimes, an academic consensus on an issue can be a strong indicator of the truth of a claim. In the absence of further information, it is generally reasonable to defer to academic opinion on an issue. The question one could ask however, is which academics do we defer to? As is suggested by Lieberman et al. (2004), one can get vew different views on whether race is a legitimate category depending on which part of the world they get their academics from<ref>Lieberman, L., Kaszycka, K. A., Fuentes, A. J. M., Yablonsky, L., Kirk, R. C., Strkalj, G., Wang, Q., & Sun, L. (2004). The race concept in six regions: variation without consensus. PubMed, 28(2), 907–921. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15666627</ref>. In the United States and Canada, anthropologists generally reject the concept of race. But in Europe, rejection rates are moderate, in Poland and Cuba they are sizable, and they are lowest in Russia and China. Depending on which region of the world one takes academics from, they can come with a very different view of the issue, and based on this international analysis, there is no real consensus on the issue. Now, maybe since 2004 there has been a stronger consensus within even places such as Russia and China. One would need to provide evidence that this is the case, but this is why we can look at the evidence itself and come to our own conclusions.

- It should firstly be said that just because a dimension can exist on a gradient, it does not imply that therefore we cannot label different parts of the gradient within the dimension. For example, color exists on a gradient, and yet there is still use in distinguishing between various colors, such as green and blue. Race may be socially constructed, as does color, but that does not mean that it is impossible to derive use from race as a category.

- But race is not in fact a gradient. Genetic clustering analysis finds that not only do human genetic clusters exist, but that they correspond strongly to predefined regional or population groups or to collections of geographically and linguistically similar populations. Predefined labels of ancestry are very informative about membership in genetic clusters, even for intermediate populations<ref>Rosenberg, N. A., Pritchard, J. K., Weber, J. L., Cann, H. M., Kidd, K. K., Zhivotovsky, L. A., & Feldman, M. W. (2002). Genetic structure of human populations. Science, 298(5602), 2381–2385. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1078311</ref>. Self-reported ancestry in fact almost perfectly corresponds to genetic cluster membership<ref>Tang, H., Quertermous, T., Rodriguez, B., Kardia, S. L., Zhu, X., Brown, A., Pankow, J. S., Province, M. A., Hunt, S. C., Boerwinkle, E., Schork, N. J., & Risch, N. J. (2005). Genetic structure, Self-Identified Race/Ethnicity, and confounding in Case-Control association studies. American Journal of Human Genetics, 76(2), 268–275. https://doi.org/10.1086/427888</ref>.

- When looking at a single loci of an individual, there is a relatively high probability of misclassifying the person's race. However, this drops to zero when looking at a sufficiently large number of loci<ref>Edwards, A. (2003). Human genetic diversity: Lewontin’s fallacy. BioEssays, 25(8), 798–801. https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.10315</ref>. There may be more variation within than between groups, but that does not mean that it is impossible to distinguish between members of differing groups. Furthermore, if it was in fact the case that more variation within than between disproved group differences, then there would be no need to talk about race differences in income, as research shows that 96% of US income inequality arises from variation within racial groups, with only a very small share attributable to differences between these groups. This pattern is stable across time and regions<ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w34558</ref>.

- Some critique genetic cluster analysis because it can be difficult to ascertain exactly how many clusters you should have. You can always infinitely divide between groups, and so they argue that there is no reason to prefer two racial groups to ten. It is true that there is some level of arbitrariness to how many groups you define. But this is an issue within biology more broadly. For example, looking at wikipedia, there are numerous subspecies of brown bear that exist in North America<ref>Wikipedia contributors. (2024, July 13). Subspecies of brown bear. Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies_of_brown_bear</ref>. One could easily argue that there is no reason why scientists defined eight subspecies, or just four, or just one. In fact, the article itself describes how there is disagreement amongst scientists as to whether certain groups can be classified as subspecies in themselves. None of this should however suggest that it is useless to make categories between different types of brown bears, even if there is some arbitrariness to it. Studying subspecies can still be useful.

- I do not mean to argue that we should consider races to be different subspecies of humans. There may be some use in doing so, and there may be some use in not doing so. The question of whether it would be useful goes beyond the scope of this article.

With an understanding of how cluster analysis shows the existence of races that correspond with self-identified ancestry to a strong degree, we can discuss what clustering finds about human populations. Empirically, this is done through k-means clustering, which divides genetic data into k clusters. Doing this with human genomes reveals the following<ref>https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2020/06/29/a-race-by-race-breakdown-of-human-genetic-diversity-illustrated-guide-for-novices/</ref>:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1Iw16MT.jpg" alt="K-Cluster Analysis" width="500">

- At K=2, the divide is between Sub-Saharan Africans and everyone else.
- At K=3, everyone else splits into West Eurasians (whites and MENAs) and Eastern Non-Africans.
- At K=4, Amerindians split from Eastern Non-Africans.
- At K=5, Sub-Saharan Africans split into two groups, what have been called in the past "Congoids" and "Capoids".
- At K=6, South Eurasians (Indians, Adamanese, Australians) split from East Asians.
- At K=7, Siberians split from East Asians.
- At K=8, South Asians split from South Eurasians.
- At K=9, West Eurasians split into Europeans and West Asians (MENAs)
- At K=10, the Hadza, a tiny African population of hunter-gatherers numbering less than 1500 people, split from other Africans.
- At K=11, Adamanese islanders split from other South Asians.
- At K=12, Amerindians split into North and South populations.
- At K=13, Pygmies diverge from other Sub-Saharan African groups.
- At K=14, Paleo-Siberians split from other Amerindians.
- At K=15, a 'Caucasian and Iranian' component appears in nearly every West Eurasian and Central/South Asian population.
- At K=16, the East African or Nilotic population splits from other Sub-Saharan Africans.
- At K=17, the Southern Amerindians split into Amazonians and other Southern Amerindians.
- At K=18, Ju'Hoansi people split from other Sub-Saharan Africans.
- At K=19, West Eurasian ancestry is split into four groups: North European, Mediterranean European, Semitic, and Caucasian and Iranian.
- At K=20, the Kalash separate from other Central/South Asians.

All of this suggests that from a biological or population genetics perspective, there is a level of use to using race as a category. It is simple, it corresponds already to most people's folk understandings of race, and it also corresponds to actual genetic differences between populations. There is a second argument against the usage of race as a category in science, and that is the concern that it can be used to legitimate oppression and claims of superiority. This argument was already addressed in a previous section.

Additionally, from a medical perspective, having consistent racial classifications can provide some value. Pharmacogenetics research has very inconsistent race and ethnic classification due to racial definitions differing between various studies. Common taxonomy of geographic ancestry could produce reproducible research and clinical implementation of its results<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612983/</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000292972030152X</ref>. There may be some benefit in using traditional folk categories if they allow for good identification by a doctor or good self-identification of one's ethnic origin, and hence of one's genetic propensities from a medical perspective.

## Implications

It is possible to assert that there are differences between races, including psychological differences, without having the concept of race necessarily be regarded as legitimate. For example, if you took a group of 100 people in a room and randomly assigned 50 to one side of the room, and the other 50 to the other side of the room, it is possible that there would exist mean group differences on a variety of metrics in spite of the complete randomness of the assignment of the groups. But even this is more of an extreme of a race than what race denialists have, because they don't suggest that races don't have differences between one another. Rather, they just suggest that race is a gradient so it's arbitrary to make a cutoff point between two groups in the gradient. In this situation, the dimension upon which the gradient exists would by definition imply a difference between the groups you identify, even if the exact cutoffs to demarcate each group group are arbitrary in nature.

### Race and Intelligence

IQ gaps between races, although the specifics have been debated, have generally been identified as existing<ref>Neisser, U., Boodoo, G., Bouchard, T. J., Boykin, A. W., Brody, N., Ceci, S. J., Halpern, D. F., Loehlin, J. C., Perloff, R., Sternberg, R. J., & Urbina, S. (1996). Intelligence: Knowns and unknowns. American Psychologist/the American Psychologist, 51(2), 77–101. https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066x.51.2.77</ref>. The most well-established gap is a 15-point or one standard deviation between African Americans and whites, where whites score higher. Furthermore, cognitive function tests are measurement invariant across groups, meaning that intelligence tests can be used to measure differences in cognition between racial groups<ref>Taylor, R. L., & Ziegler, E. W. (1987). Comparison of the first principal factor on the WISC-R across ethnic groups. Educational and Psychological Measurement, 47(3), 691–694. https://doi.org/10.1177/001316448704700318</ref><ref>Barnes, L. L., Yumoto, F., Capuano, A., Wilson, R. S., Bennett, D. A., & Tractenberg, R. E. (2015). Examination of the Factor Structure of a Global Cognitive Function Battery across Race and Time. Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 22(1), 66–75. https://doi.org/10.1017/s1355617715001113
</ref><ref>Kaufman, A. S., Kaufman, J. C., & McLean, J. E. (1995). Factor structure of the Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test (KAIT) for Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics. Educational and Psychological Measurement, 55(3), 365–376. https://doi.org/10.1177/0013164495055003001</ref>. Test bias does not explain these gaps. The black-white IQ gap is larger on "non-cultural" test items compared to "cultural" test items because non-cultural items require more sheer reasoning ability<ref>Jensen, A. R., & McGurk, F. C. (1987). Black-white bias in ‘cultural’ and ‘noncultural’ test items. Personality and Individual Differences, 8(3), 295–301. https://doi.org/10.1016/0191-8869(87)90029-8</ref>. The primary aspect of the debate surrounding race and intelligence concerns not the measured intelligence differences between various groups, but rather the cause for the differences.

It should be noted that the most recent polling that I am aware of suggests that only 16% of experts on intelligence believe in a 100% environmental explanation for the black-white difference in IQ<ref>Rindermann, H., Becker, D., & Coyle, T. R. (2020). Survey of expert opinion on intelligence: Intelligence research, experts’ background, controversial issues, and the media. Intelligence, 78, 101406. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2019.101406</ref>. This should strongly imply from the outset that an explanation for the gaps which involves genetics is potentially plausible, given the expert opinion on the issue. I believe that the cause for racial differences in intelligence is a mix of genetics and environment. I conservatiely suggest that these gaps are about 60-80% genetic and 20-40% environmental.

#### Why a Partial Genetic Perspective is Possible

The cultural loading that we are subjected to within modern societies primes people to be less sympathetic to genetic explanations for psychological differences between groups. From a pure evolutionary perspective, any two populations which are isolated from one another or reproduce independently from one another for a sufficiently long period of time will develop significant differences, some of which will be cognitive. 

Chimpanzees and gorillas have different cognitive abilities, in spite of them being in identical environments in some cases, due to them having different sexual selective patterns and/or different natural selective pressures. Certainly, this took a longer time than it did for racial groups to differentiate from one another. Humans started travelling out of Africa about 70,000 to 50,000 years ago<ref>Global Human Journey. (n.d.). https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/global-human-journey/</ref>, which is much shorter than the millions of years of separation chimpanzees had from gorillas.

<img src="https://images.nationalgeographic.org/image/upload/t_edhub_resource_key_image/v1638889806/EducationHub/photos/global-human-journey.jpg" alt="Map of the Global Human Journey" width="500">

Map of the Global Human Journey<ref>Global Human Journey. (n.d.). https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/global-human-journey/</ref>.

We can examine however recent evolution of Homo Sapiens. Evidence suggests that much of the evolution of homo sapiens into the species that it is today took place over the past one million years<ref>Handwerk, B. (2021, September 15). An evolutionary timeline of Homo Sapiens. Smithsonian Magazine. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/essential-timeline-understanding-evolution-homo-sapiens-180976807/</ref>. We can take this as a rough proxy for how long it may take for large intelligence differences to emerge between groups assuming normal evolution patterns, as the predecessor to Homo Sapiens must have evolved our traits over that period of time, including our significantly higher cognitive ability relative to predecessors such as Homo Heidelbergensis.

The question then arises, were the patterns of human evolution which emerged over the past 70,000-50,000 years normal? There is research suggesting that since 40,000 years ago, human evolution has been speeding up, and has become 100 times faster in the past 5000 years alone<ref>Gibbons, A. (2007, December 10). Human Evolution Is Speeding Up: New study says that 7% of human genes are evolving rapidly. Science. https://www.science.org/content/article/human-evolution-speeding</ref>. Looking solely at the evolution that has occurred over the past 5000 years, this would be equivalent to evolution occurring at a normal speed of 500,000 years. Not as much as the million year estimate for species-differentiating intelligence changes to occur, but still intuitively enough for some intelligence differences to emerge between populations.

Furthermore, there is direct genetic evidence to suggest that significant population differentiation exists in many characteristics of the brain. Wu & Zhang (2011) found that between human populations, genes relating to brain characteristics, including pituitary gland development, dorsoventral neural tube patterning, hindbrain development, positive regulation of neuron differentiation, and neuron development all differed more between groups than genes relating to skin color, including pigmentation and melanocyte differentiation<ref>https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-11-16</ref>:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iGzvQ.png" alt="Human Population Differentiation" width="500">

In other words, there is actually stronger evidence that genetic brain differences exist between populations than there is that genetic skin color differences exist between populations! While this doesn't directly suggest that intelligence per se will be implicated in these differences, it significantly opens up the door for that possibility.

#### Evidence for a Partial Genetic Perspective

So if it is possible or plausible that there exist genetic racial IQ gaps, what might be the mechanism surrounding it? Evolution generally occurs because different organisms exist in different environments and are thus subject to differing evolutionary pressures. These pressures can affect physical or psychological traits of an individual. One hypothesis is the "Cold Winters Theory", which posits that people in colder temperatures are more likely to evolve higher intelligence over time due to the pressures it puts on those people for innovativeness in harsh climates. IQ has in fact been found to be related to climatic variables in African and Eurasian countries<ref>Templer, D. I., & Stephens, J. S. (2014). The relationship between IQ and climatic variables in African and Eurasian countries. Intelligence, 46, 169–178. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2014.06.001</ref>. The evolved threefold increase in the size of the hominid brain since Homo Habilis has been identified to be a product of factors, with paleoclimatic variation being one of the factors involved<ref>Bailey, D. H., & Geary, D. C. (2009). Hominid brain evolution. Human Nature, 20(1), 67–79. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-008-9054-0</ref>. The cranial capacities of hominid skulls in fact are highly correlated with paleoclimatic changes in temperature<ref>Ash, J., & Gallup, G. G. (2007). Paleoclimatic Variation and Brain Expansion during Human Evolution. Human Nature, 18(2), 109–124. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-007-9015-z</ref>. Nicholson et al. (2024) found that colder and more variable temperatures have a positive within-species effect on brain size evolution, which is likely related to biological adaptations to mitigate against hypothermia. However, this effect diminished over time in the Homo genus, suggesting that in later species such as us and Neanderthals brain sizes were less affected by climatic and environmental pressures, although still were to some degree nonetheless<ref>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.09.611970v1.abstract</ref>.

It should be noted that head size is correlated with IQ<ref>Pietschnig, J., Penke, L., Wicherts, J. M., Zeiler, M., & Voracek, M. (2015). Meta-analysis of associations between human brain volume and intelligence differences: How strong are they and what do they mean? Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews/Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 57, 411–432. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.09.017</ref>, and white and black children matched on IQ show no difference in mean head size<ref>Jensen, A. R., & Johnson, F. W. (1994). Race and sex differences in head size and IQ. Intelligence, 18(3), 309–333. https://doi.org/10.1016/0160-2896(94)90032-9</ref>. Asians generally have the highest cranial capacity, followed by Europeans, and then Africans<ref>Rushton, J., & Rushton, E. W. (2003). Brain size, IQ, and racial-group differences. Intelligence, 31(2), 139–155. https://doi.org/10.1016/s0160-2896(02)00137-x</ref><ref>Rushton, J. P., Ankney, C. D., & University of Western Ontario. (1996). Brain size and cognitive ability: Correlations with age, sex, social class, and race. In Psychonomic Bulletin & Review (Vols. 1–1, pp. 21–36). Psychonomic Society, Inc. https://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Brain-Size-and-Cognitive-Ability-Correlations-with-Age-Sex-Social-Class-and-Race-1996-by-John-Philippe-Rushton-C.-Davison-Ankney.pdf</ref>.

Additionally, the differences in head size and hence by proxy IQ have been identified to be at least 10,000 years old, long before any factors of racism would play a role<ref>Lynn, R. (2010). Consistency of race differences in intelligence over millennia: A comment on Wicherts, Borsboom and Dolan. Personality and Individual Differences, 48(2), 100–101. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2009.09.007</ref> (although that is getting ahead). So therefore, there is an identified mechanism through which racial differences in intelligence could emerge, and it is consistent with observations in reality. Blacks and whites evolved in different climates, the colder climates whites evolved in selected for higher intelligence, and these result in existing head size and intelligence differences we observe in reality today.

Sidenote, there is a distinction between craniometry, the measurement of head size, and phrenology, which looks at scalp morphology. The discussion here is employing only craniometry, and not phrenology which has been identified to be a pseudoscience<ref>Jones, O. P., Alfaro-Almagro, F., & Jbabdi, S. (2018). An empirical, 21st century evaluation of phrenology. Cortex, 106, 26–35. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2018.04.011</ref>.

Recent research has begun to examine directional selection in the DNA in ancient humans. More specifically, Akbari et al. (2024) looked at allele frequencies in 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14,000 years and 6510 contemporary people, and found that hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. This selection includes alleles for lighter skin color, lower risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance including scores on intelligence tests, household income and years of schooling<ref>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.14.613021v1</ref>. This also suggests positive selection of intelligence for Europeans, which could explain population differences. Piffer & Kirkegaard (2024) similarly examined directional selection in European populations from the Paleolithic to modern times, finding that there was positive directional selection for polygenic scores associated with educational attainment, intelligence and socioeconomic status over the past 12,000 years<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/article/evolutionary-trends-of-polygenic-scores-in-european-populations-from-the-paleolithic-to-modern-times/E76E2C78FFC3DA9BDEB0BC8E37D9273D</ref>. Interestingly, they also found that schizophrenia and autism showed different temporal patterns, consistent with theories suggesting they are psychological opposites. Similar results were also found by Kuijpers et al. (2022), who found that after the Neolithic, European populations experienced an increase in height and intelligence scores and decreased skin pigmentation<ref>https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.833190/full.</ref>.

Another line of evidence that strongly implies that racial differences in intelligence exist is the issue of genetic variation between populations. There have been numerous studies which look at whether genes related to IQ vary across populations. Davide Piffer has done several studies on this. In a 2015 study he found that alleles exhibiting significant and replicable positive associations with IQ are strongly correlated with country-level IQ. Allele frequencies varied by continents in a way corresponding to population differences in intelligence<ref>Piffer, D. (2015). A review of intelligence GWAS hits: Their relationship to country IQ and the issue of spatial autocorrelation. Intelligence, 53, 43–50. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.08.008</ref>. Additionally, in a 2019 study he found that polygenic scores for educational attainment and intelligence were found to correlate with population differences in IQ, with Asian populations at the highest, followed by Europeans, followed by Africans<ref>Evidence for Recent Polygenic Selection on Educational Attainment and Intelligence Inferred from Gwas Hits: A Replication of Previous Findings Using Recent Data. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332076417_Evidence_for_Recent_Polygenic_Selection_on_Educational_Attainment_and_Intelligence_Inferred_from_Gwas_Hits_A_Replication_of_Previous_Findings_Using_Recent_Data</ref>. Research by Curtis Dunkel and his colleagues investigated the Jewish advantage in intelligence compared to Catholics and Lutherans and found that it was significantly mediated by group differences in a polygenic score for educational attainment, cognitive ability, and self-rated mathematical ability<ref>Polygenic scores mediate the Jewish phenotypic advantage in educational attainment and cognitive ability compared with Catholics and Lutherans. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330601752_Polygenic_Scores_Mediate_the_Jewish_Phenotypic_Advantage_in_Educational_Attainment_and_Cognitive_Ability_Compared_With_Catholics_and_Lutherans</ref>. Further research from Shi and colleagues found that many of the amino acid polymorphic sites from the brain size regulating gene CASC5 have high frequencies of derived alleles in East Asians, but are rare in Europeans and Africans. This suggests that there was natural selection that tended to favor a larger gray matter volume in East Asians<ref>Shi, L., Hu, E., Wang, Z., Liu, J., Li, J., Li, M., Chen, H., Yu, C., Jiang, T., & Su, B. (2016). Regional selection of the brain size regulating gene CASC5 provides new insight into human brain evolution. Human Genetics, 136(2), 193–204. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00439-016-1748-5</ref>. Additionally, this type of polygenic score research can be used to predict intelligence in other populations than where the polygenic score data was derived from. European polygenic scores for example predict mean IQs of Chinese provinces for instance<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384250199_Predictive_Accuracy_of_Polygenic_Scores_from_European_GWAS_among_Chinese_Provinces</ref>.

There have been critiques of this line of research which it would be dishonest to ignore, but they are unconvincing at best. Freese and colleagues point out that in Dunkel's study, the polygenic score differences would lead one to significantly overestimate the disparity in IQ that exists in reality, suggesting that one should be careful when interpreting group polygenic score differences<ref>Problems with a Causal Interpretation of Polygenic Score Differences between Jewish and non-Jewish Respondents in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334385807_Problems_with_a_Causal_Interpretation_of_Polygenic_Score_Differences_between_Jewish_and_non-Jewish_Respondents_in_the_Wisconsin_Longitudinal_Study</ref>. The use of polygenic scores has also been criticized on the basis that they can often make predictions between groups that don’t fare in reality<ref>Rosenberg, N. A., Edge, M. D., Pritchard, J. K., & Feldman, M. W. (2018). Interpreting polygenic scores, polygenic adaptation, and human phenotypic differences. Evolution, Medicine and Public Health, 2019(1), 26–34. https://doi.org/10.1093/emph/eoy036</ref>. For example, polygenic score differences would predict that West Africans are much shorter than Europeans, when this isn’t the case<ref>Problems with a Causal Interpretation of Polygenic Score Differences between Jewish and non-Jewish Respondents in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334385807_Problems_with_a_Causal_Interpretation_of_Polygenic_Score_Differences_between_Jewish_and_non-Jewish_Respondents_in_the_Wisconsin_Longitudinal_Study</ref>. This appears to be a very weak criticism, as even if in not every case a polygenic score prediction will perfectly match population distributions of a trait, the fact that the scores match populations distributions in exactly the way a genetic explanation for racial IQ gaps would predict suggests a genetic racial IQ gap exists. Furthermore, this doesn't appear to be the case when it comes to polygenic scores of intelligence/educational attainment. For example, Piffer & Kirkegaard (2024) found that European-derived polygenic scores actually predicted IQ levels across Chinese provinces better than Chinese-derived polygenic scores, likely owing to the larger sample size in the European-derived scores<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384250199_Predictive_Accuracy_of_Polygenic_Scores_from_European_GWAS_among_Chinese_Provinces</ref>.

More recently, more sophisticated research utilizing admixture analysis has been conducted to understand how genetic ancestry affects intelligence. Looking at Hispanic and Latino adults, Xia et al. (2024) finds that several genes associated with European ancestry tended to predict higher intelligence in Hispanics, while several genes associated with Amerindian and African ancestry tended to predict lower intelligence<ref>https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.14082</ref>.

A final line of evidence concerns MRI scans. MRI analysis indicates significant brain differences between groups of people, and various forms of imaging and geometric data on brains can predict a person's genetic ancestry at a very high performance<ref>Rao, N. P., Jeelani, H., Achalia, R., Achalia, G., Jacob, A., Bharath, R. D., Varambally, S., Venkatasubramanian, G., & Yalavarthy, P. K. (2017). Population differences in brain morphology: Need for population specific brain template. Psychiatry Research. Neuroimaging, 265, 1–8. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pscychresns.2017.03.018</ref><ref>Altmann, A., Mourao-Miranda, J., Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London, & Max Planck University College London Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research. (2018). EVIDENCE FOR BIAS OF GENETIC ANCESTRY IN RESTING STATE FUNCTIONAL MRI. In bioRxiv [Journal-article]. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/440776v1.full.pdf</ref><ref>Fan, C. C., Bartsch, H., Schork, A. J., Chen, C., Wang, Y., Lo, M., Brown, T. T., Kuperman, J. M., Hagler, D. J., Schork, N. J., Jernigan, T. L., & Dale, A. M. (2015). Modeling the 3D Geometry of the Cortical Surface with Genetic Ancestry. CB/Current Biology, 25(15), 1988–1992. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2015.06.006</ref>. This by itself does not imply that there exists genetic differences in intelligence between racial groups, but it does strongly imply that there are general brain differences which biologically differ between groups. Any environmental explanation for the high predictive power of brain imaging seems rather dubious from the outset. Kirkegaard and Fuerst found that when applying a multimodal MRI-based predictor of intelligence, race can confound models when a multiracial training sample is used because models learn to predict race and use race to predict intelligence<ref>A multimodal MRI-based predictor of intelligence and its relation to Race/Ethnicity. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369479241_A_Multimodal_MRI-based_Predictor_of_Intelligence_and_Its_Relation_to_RaceEthnicity</ref>. So models developed to try and predict intelligence use race to predict a person's intelligence when given MRI data. This strongly implies that race qua race is a factor which drives intelligence differences between people.

#### Absence of Evidence for a Full Environmental Perspective

So all of the aforementioned information taken together strongly suggests that one cannot explain racial intelligence differences without taking into account genetics. We can also look at it from the other angle. If we rule out reasonable environmental explanations for racial IQ gaps, it follows that genetics is a reasonable explanation for at least part of the gaps. Several factors are examined here:

- **Socioeconomics -** When socioeconomic status is controlled for, black-white gaps in intelligence do not go away<ref>Neisser, U., Boodoo, G., Bouchard, T. J., Boykin, A. W., Brody, N., Ceci, S. J., Halpern, D. F., Loehlin, J. C., Perloff, R., Sternberg, R. J., & Urbina, S. (1996). Intelligence: Knowns and unknowns. American Psychologist/the American Psychologist, 51(2), 77–101. https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066x.51.2.77</ref>. Most discrimination, past or present that blacks may face relative to whites would likely strongly predict a low socioeconomic status, so we can use SES as a predictor of potential discrimination or injustice. Blacks matched on socioeconomic status to whites still have a lower IQ. However, it is arguably fallacious to even do this, as there is a chicken and egg problem with looking at socioeconomic status. Sure, a low socioeconomic status can cause a lower IQ, so this can explain IQ gaps between groups, but a lower IQ also causes a lower socioeconomic status. Blacks may have a lower socioeconomic status in part of in whole because of their genetically lower IQ, and controlling for their socioeconomic status erases this genetic effect. To control for socioeconomic status would thus be to control for genetics itself, the very factor we are trying to isolate away in the controls. This issue is commonly known as the "[sociologist's fallacy](https://prometheandissident.github.io/epistemic-progressivism-supplement/#sociologist%E2%80%99s-fallacy)".

- **Racism -** Racism is often used to explain disparities in intelligence. It's extremely nebulous and hence can always be reformed to make the hypothesis that race gaps in IQ are due to discrimination nearly unfalsifiable. Nonetheless, some research has been done on this. In order for one to suggest that racial gaps in intelligence are caused by racism, one would have to firstly demonstrate a negative correlation between racism one experiences and their intelligence level. But evidence suggests that a negative correlation does not exist. In fact in the United States, the black-white IQ gap tends to be smaller in counties with more republicans, more white people, and higher implicit anti-black racism<ref>Systemic racism does not explain variation in race gaps on cognitive tests. (n.d.). ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377204444_Systemic_Racism_Does_Not_Explain_Variation_in_Race_Gaps_on_Cognitive_Tests</ref>. This suggests that in the places with the lowest levels of racism, there are higher IQ gaps between blacks and whites, and so controlling for whatever disproportionate level of racism blacks face would make the environmentalist argument more difficult to sustain. They would have to explain a larger gap.

- **Stereotype Threat -** A subset of the racism argument is the notion of stereotype threat. It is the notion that gaps in intelligence may be due to certain groups perceiving themselves as less academically gifted which will reflect in poor intelligence test performance. This firstly would likely contradict evidence presented beforehand that cognitive function tests are measurement invariant across groups, unless this stereotype threat was equally ubiquitous across all domains relating to cognitive ability as opposed to just IQ tests. This seems from the outset to be a highly dubious assumption, but evidence on stereotype threat directly does not suggest that it is a significant factor explaining group intelligence gaps. There exists strong publication bias in the stereotype threat literature which suggests that the effect of stereotype threat may simply be null<ref>Zigerell, L. J. (2017). Potential publication bias in the stereotype threat literature: Comment on Nguyen and Ryan (2008). Journal of Applied Psychology, 102(8), 1159–1168. https://doi.org/10.1037/apl0000188</ref>. Furthermore, black people on average have higher-levels of self-esteem<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12002695/</ref> and rate themselves are more intelligent than whites<ref>https://researchers.one/articles/24.02.00005.pdf</ref>. This suggests that if anything, the effects of "stereotype threat" if they exist may actually benefit black people in practice, meaning they cannot explain the IQ gap.

- **Infectious Disease -** Exposure to infectious disease has been shown to be a strong predictor of IQ across both American states and across countries internationally<ref>Eppig, C. (2024, February 20). Why is average IQ higher in some places? Scientific American. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-average-iq-higher-in-some-places/</ref>. This may be a partial predictor, but no evidence has been presented to suggest that it entirely explains the gap, especially when this exposure would likely be strongly correlated with socioeconomic status which controlling for does not eliminate the black-white IQ gap.

- **The Closing of the Gap -** There is some evidence that the black-white IQ gap may have closed a few points in recent decades<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3146648#:~:text=I%20review%20the%20evidence%20on,so%20due%20to%20methodological%20flaws</ref>. However, even with this possible closing the IQ gap is still substantial and it is not clear to what degree the narrowing was g-loaded. Furthermore, a recent study using a nationally representative sample of 12,000 American children found an 18-point black-white IQ gap, suggesting that the gap still likely persists and hasn't closed to any real degree<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369479241_A_Multimodal_MRI-based_Predictor_of_Intelligence_and_Its_Relation_to_RaceEthnicity</ref>. In addition, measures of intelligence differences in the past suggest that the black-white IQ gap was about a standard deviation in the 19th century, basically the same as it is now<ref>https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-deep-roots-of-intelligence-differences?open=false#%C2%A7admixture-effects-a-case-of-deep-roots</ref>. This strongly implies that the origin of the gap is at least partially genetic, given the vast differences in relative and absolute environments that black people would have faced between the 19th century which has had no strong effect on the gap.

The bottom line is that environmental explanations certainly account for a portion of racial gaps in intelligence, but there has been no strong evidence to suggest that they entirely explain the gaps. That is why this article promotes a mixed genetics-environment explanation for group differences in cognitive ability.

#### Approximating the Gene-Environment Influences

I have not done extensive research on the degree to which racial IQ gaps are genetic or environment. The evidence presented above strongly implies a dual role, but says little about the relative influences. Nonetheless I have devised a rough method by which one can quantify the gene-environment influences, utilizing heritability estimates from research.

Overall, most research suggests that intelligence is overall about 60-80% heritable (see psychology page). We can say that this is a pooled estimate for the heritability of intelligence, including people of all races. This means that population genetic variation explains 60-80% of the variation in trait intelligence. We can call this "relevant genetic variation". At the same time, the heritability estimate suggests that population environmental variation explains 20-40% of the variation in trait intelligence. We can call this "relevant environmental variation". We can compare this pooled heritability estimate to the heritability estimates of individual ethnic groups, or "group heritability estimates".

If it is the case that racial intelligence gaps were 100% environmental, that would mean that the relevant genetic variation would be identical in pooled samples as in individual group samples. Meanwhile, the pooled sample would have a higher relevant environmental variation than the individual group samples as it would include groups with different intelligence scores which are different entirely due to environment. Thus, moving from a pooled sample to a group sample, we would expect the heritability to be higher as the relevant environmental variation would decrease, meaning the relevant genetic variation would play a higher role. Conversely, if the gap was mostly genetic, we would expect the heritability to decrease as the effect of the reduction in relevant genetic variation moving from a pooled to group sample would exceed the effect of the reduction in relevant environmental variation. If group IQ differences are as much genetic and environmental as individual differences are, we would expect the heritability to be the same, as the reductions in the relevant environmental and genetic variations would cancel each other out when moving from pooled to group sampling. 

Research suggests that there exists no ethnic differences in the heritability of intelligence<ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2019.101408</ref>, and that the heritability of intelligence among both blacks and whites is about 0.6. This is within the range of the pooled heritability of intelligence, if not slightly lower. Therefore, I conclude that the black-white IQ gap, and likely other racial IQ gaps, are caused by as much a mix of genetics and environment as individual differences in intelligence. That is, the gap is 60-80% genetic and 20-40% environmental.

#### Implications

Group IQ differences can help in part explain differences in wealth across countries. There is a positive correlation between national IQ score and innovation<ref>https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/76922/</ref>. Nations with higher average intelligence are more liberal (greater highest marginal individual tax rate and thus lower economic inequality), are less religious, and are more monogamous. Average intelligence appears to be the strongest predictor of these traits<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-biosocial-science/article/abs/iq-and-the-values-of-nations/B28886FC682668151084DF2E9DC5C0AF</ref>. Beyond this however, group differences can help to explain the debate about the degree to which disparities between groups are due to discrimination. This is discussed in more detail in the section entitled "[The Modern Narrative on Racism](https://prometheandissident.github.io/race/#the-modern-narrative-on-racism)", but it is worth noting here. Contrary to claims that research on group differences in useless, it has significant implications and explanatory power in explaining a number of phenomena that society cares about.

Importantly, however, IQ doesn't explain every difference between groups. For example, people from Northeast Asian countries, despite having very high mean iqs, win relatively few Nobel prizes. This appears to be in part due to differences in curiosity and independent thinking<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282411443_Why_Do_Northeast_Asians_Win_So_Few_Nobel_Prizes#:~:text=less%20than%205%25%20of%20Nobel%20laureates</ref>, some of a multitude of psychological racial differences that exist other than IQ.

### Other Psychological Racial Differences

There have been other psychological differences between races which have been identified. The full discussion about how these are plausible will not be here, as it was already addressed in the race and intelligence section. It was already demonstrated how there are significant differences between races in brain structure, which are likely heavily mediated by genetics, and hence intuitively many psychological differences would be in part genetic:

- **Novelty-Seeking -** Research suggests there exists a positive correlation between novelty-seeking DRD4 polymorphisms and human migration distance out of Africa<ref>Matthews, L. J., & Butler, P. M. (2011). Novelty‐seeking DRD4 polymorphisms are associated with human migration distance out‐of‐Africa after controlling for neutral population gene structure. American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 145(3), 382–389. https://doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.21507</ref>. This makes intuitive sense given that those who would travel outside of Africa would likely be those who are open to novel environments and are generally more exploratory.

- **Individualism/Collectivism Orientation -** There exist various genetic markers of social sensitivity which reflect the degree of emotional responsivity to social events and experiences. There exists a robust cross-national correlation between the frequency of variants in these genes and their collectivism and also incidence of major depression and anxiety and mood disorders. This implies a genetic contribution to cultural differences, where east Asian cultures tend to be more genetically collectivistic and European cultures tend to be more genetically individualistic<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20592043/</ref><ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842692/</ref>. Part of the reason why this may have evolutionarily arisen is as an evolutionary response to disease prevalence in various areas. The regional prevalence of pathogens has a strong positive correlation with collectivism<ref>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2008.0094</ref>. This might also provide a genetic explanation for the lower levels of ethnocentrism that white people exhibit today.

- **Substance Dependence -** Native Americans appear to lack several protective variants of genes that would reduce their probability of alcoholism<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3603686/</ref>. This could in part explain higher levels of substance dependence among Native Americans.

Importantly, however, not all psychological traits differ significantly between groups. For example, Kajonius & Giolla (2017) found that when examining personality traits across countries, the overall contribution to personality traits from countries was less than 2%, suggesting that national origin contributes a very small proportion to aggregate personality traits relative to individual or within-country differences<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179646</ref>. This also points to small group differences in big five personality. Similar results were found by a 2008 meta-analysis, which suggested that group differences in personality were negligible under most measures<ref>https://psytopaca.asso-web.com/uploaded/group-differences-in-personality-foldes-et-al-pp-2008.pdf</ref>.

## Understanding Race as a Social Phenomenon

It is difficult to dispute the notion that race is a major social issue within modern societies. Investigating the reasons for why race is generally seen as being significant to many people is essential to helping alleviate conflict. This section will discuss ethnocentrism, research on ethnic diversity, and interracial marriage. The ultimate theme of this section will be that while a biological view of race has important implications which are unfortunately ignored, stigmatized or even blacklisted in mainstream discourse, many race realists fall into the trap of having a hammer and assuming everything is thus a nail. Race realism should be a reality that is discussed openly, in a similar way that the health effects of obesity are. They have to be discussed when making policy or in certain social contexts, but it shouldn't invade every aspect of our lives and there's many areas where it's simply impolite to bring it up. Ethical questions surrounding race should be answered in similar ways to how ethical questions surrounding individuals or families are answered.

### Ethnocentrism: Descriptively and Ethically

Human morality fundamentally derives from concentric circles of obligation that one has to individuals who are gradually less and less related to oneself. This is because people are interested in passing down their genes and yet need the assistance of others to survive. Even when an individual does not survive, if someone genetically related to them survives, that is still in part a passage of one's genes. Thus, humans will naturally feel a greater sense of obligation towards those that they are genetically similar to. This can be seen with nepotism and preference for one's family; followed by preference for friends, community, and race/ethnicity, followed by a general preference for humanity. One can even extend this back to different animals. Humans feel less bad about killing an ant compared to a rabbit, in part because the rabbit appears more genetically similar.

These concentric circles of obligation explain why some degree of ethnocentrism appears to have arisen through evolution. It will naturally dominate over pure selfish strategies because it doesn't induce sufficient cooperation, and it will naturally dominate over pure humanitarian strategies because those with ingroup preferences will free ride over those without such preferences<ref>https://www.jasss.org/16/3/7.html</ref>.

The normality of ingroup bias can help to explain why high in-group bias is positively related to self-esteem<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1207/S15327957PSPR0402_04</ref>, and that across racial groups a sense of ethnic identity is positively associated with well-being<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0272431699019003001</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0272431600020001003</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10902-016-9735-z</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20141011215233/http://psychcentral.com/news/archives/2006-10/wfu-eig102006.html</ref>. Interactions between those of other racial groups is more psychologically difficult for a lot of people, which is why interracial interactions have been found to impair executive functioning<ref>https://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/spcl/documents/depletion_JPSP05.pdf</ref>. Across cultures, kinship is positively related to the level of altruism individuals are willing to engage in<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17456276/</ref>, something that even extends to simple friendships, as pairs of friends on average had the same level of genetic relation as people did with a fourth cousin<ref>https://www.livescience.com/46791-friends-share-genes.html</ref>. Social biases that favor the ingroup are present at an early age, as research suggests that they exist even during infancy prior to the time when any degree of socialization can occur<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20180221165808/https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/babies-prefer-individuals-who-harm-those-that-arent-like-them.html</ref>. Empathic neural responses among individuals are heightened for members of the same race, but not among those of other races, although researchers in this study suggested that this may not be inevitable and may result from culturally acquired prejudice<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982210004306</ref>. Empathy for ingroup members appears to be neurologically distinct from empathy for mankind more generally, however <ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910003125?via%3Dihub</ref>, suggesting an underlying neurological basis for these biases that goes beyond socialization.

Beyond kin selection, another reason why ethnocentrism may evolve to a degree is to mitigate the risk of disease. In ancestral environments, interactions with outgroups increased the probability of contracting diseases that outgroups possess antibodies for but the ingroup does not. This may have led to an evolved degree ot xenophobia. Research suggests that ethnocentric attitudes increase as a function of perceived disease vulnerability as well as disgust sensitivty<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20170205091117/https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fessler/pubs/NavarreteDiseaseEHB2006.pdf</ref>, corroborating this theory. Somewhat related to this, patients who are the same race as their doctor report more satisfaction with their physician and are more likely to pick doctors of the same race<ref>https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2002/race-concordance</ref><ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2875760/</ref>. Among African Americans and Latinos, this is mediated by their beliefs about discrimination in healthcare<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1466852/</ref>.

This ingroup bias is likely relatively malleable. For example research suggests that exposure to other races decreases racial prejudice and increases liking for strangers of that race<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16737372/</ref><ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2705986/</ref>, pointing to an environmental influence on ingroup preference. Still, an ingroup preference exists in every racial group. The only group which doesn't have this is white liberals, who have a negative ingroup bias (in other words, an outgroup preference)<ref>https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/americas-white-saviors</ref>. But the fact that white people have the lowest level of ingroup bias amongst every racial group might help to explain why white people tend to have lower levels of self-esteem than black people<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12002695/</ref>, as well as worse mental health and higher suicide rates compared to at least most other racial groups<ref>https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Cultural-Competency/Mental-Health-Disparities/Mental-Health-Facts-for-Diverse-Populations.pdf</ref><ref>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2780380</ref><ref>https://yaleglobalhealthreview.com/2017/05/14/white-male-suicide-the-exception-to-privelege/</ref>. This furthermore might be one factor behind why mixed race people are the most likely of any racial group to report having a mental illness<ref>https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Cultural-Competency/Mental-Health-Disparities/Mental-Health-Facts-for-Diverse-Populations.pdf</ref>, as mixed race people tend not have a coherent or strong racial identity.

In many areas within today's cultural climate there is a large push to suppress a natural ingroup bias. The notion of racism, which will be discussed later, has had its definition infinitely expanded to include an ever larger set of behaviors, including having some degree of ingroup preference (at least when it's whites having the ingroup preference). But experimental psychological research suggests that ingroup favoritism is not necessarily linked with outgroup hostility. Furthermore, ethnocentrism and xenophobia appear to be uncorrelated with one another<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/323821?journalCode=ca&</ref>.

And this reality can be seen when examining these ingroup biases, in the form of ethnocentrism but also familial bias in a number of contexts. Family gatherings and other social events which implicitly prioritize the family are seen as perfectly acceptable. In fact, those who reject such types of ingroup associative behaviors are often pathologized. Furthermore, this familial bias does not produce with it a hatred for those outside the family. Similarly, many individuals, particularly those from nonwhite groups, tend to associate with those of their own ethnicity more often than at random. There exist many race and ethnicity-based associations (mostly for nonwhite groups) which exist in societies and are seen as being perfectly acceptable. Those who engage in such associative behavior likewise do not have a hatred for those outside of their ethnic or racial group.

Nonetheless, there are behaviors which are seen as clearly going too far when it comes to familial bias for instance. Nepotism is generally looked down in social contexts, because it destroys public meritocracy in favor of privileging those who happen to be genetically related. There are clear boundaries where familial ingroup bias can go too far, and similar standards should exist with ethnicity. Police bias in favor of their family members should be seen as bad, as should racial bias in police. Familial bias in hiring should be seen as bad, as should racial bias in hiring. Societies, in order to function as societies with a diverse set of individuals, require some level of throwing away of ingroup biases in public contexts. In private contexts, such as interpersonal gatherings however, such biases should not be frowned upon.

While some may view this as being a particularly radical position, this is in some sense a description of what already occurs in general. People tend to associate with those who are similar to them, and this is merely an argument for that being normal and acceptable. It only finds controversy in that I think this ought to be applied consistently across groups. For instance, whites should be allowed to have their own associations on a small scale in the private realm if they choose to without stigma, in the same way that non-whites do.

### Research on the Effects of Ethnic Diversity

Understanding ethnocentrism as relatively natural, this can help to understand why research on ethnic diversity suggests that it can oftentimes have negative effects on society. Several broad themes emerge from examining the effects of ethnic diversity:

- People generally feel a greater sense of community when those around them are of a similar ethnic group. This can have downstream effects on social trust, altruism, conflict, economic growth, health, birth rates, and poverty.

- This effect can be moderated with more intergroup contact, and contexts where cleavages are less salient, either due to lower economic divides or a sense of need for unification.

- Furthermore, the big meta-analysis done in this research strongly suggests that these effects, while significant, are going to have little explanatory power when discussing disparities in outcomes across countries or other study groups.

- Ethnic diversity also works differently with different people. Those who are higher in openness to experience are less likely to experience negative side effects of diversity.

- Diversity, when it brings about greater levels of experience and ideas generation can have positive effects in terms of innovation.

In sum, there is a small tradeoff between ethnic diversity qua ethnic diversity, and diversity in experience and education that is often associated with ethnic diversity. However, there are many complexities present with this tradeoff and the research in general. There is a tendency among many to use this research to suggest that ethnic diversity explains all of the problems in modern society. While such individuals may make true claims in certain contexts, these generally appear to be over-estensions of the research into areas where they should not be applied. Ethnic diversity is a factor to consider when discussing sociological dynamics, but it is by no means the sole or even primary factor in explaining such phenomena generally. Complexities surrounding this research will be discussed in turn below.

#### Social Effects: Mixed

The overall research suggests that ethnic diversity has negative effects on social trust, based on results from both meta-analytical and experimental data and also a literature review on the subject. However, this varies according to measure, and the evidence suggests the effect is strongest in the context of within-neighborhood interactions<ref>Glaeser, E. L., Laibson, D. I., Scheinkman, J. A., & Soutter, C. L. (2000). Measuring trust. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 811–812. https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/laibson/files/measuring_trust.pdf</ref><ref>Van Der Meer, T., & Tolsma, J. (2014). Ethnic diversity and its effects on social cohesion. Annual Review of Sociology, 40(1), 459–478. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043309</ref><ref>Dinesen, P. T., Schaeffer, M., & Sønderskov, K. M. (2020). Ethnic Diversity and Social Trust: A Narrative and Meta-Analytical Review. Annual Review of Political Science, 23(1), 441–465. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-polisci-052918-020708</ref>. Conversely, there is a positive relationship between co-ethnic concentration and trust in neighbors<ref>Wu, Z., Hou, F., Schimmele, C., & Carmichael, A. (2017). Co-ethnic concentration and trust in Canada’s urban neighbourhoods. Urban Studies, 55(10), 2159–2178. https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098017708939</ref>. Interestingly, immigrants appear to also adopt levels of social trust consistent with those of native-born citizens, and this effect becomes stronger for second-generation immigrants<ref>Dinesen, P. T., & Hooghe, M. (2010). When in Rome, Do as the Romans Do: The Acculturation of Generalized Trust among Immigrants in Western Europe. In Center for Migration Studies of New York, International Migration Review (Vols. 44–44, Issue Number 3, pp. 697–727). https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-7379.2010.00822.x</ref><ref>Helliwell, J. F., Wang, S., & Xu, J. (2015). How Durable are Social Norms? Immigrant Trust and Generosity in 132 Countries. Social Indicators Research, 128(1), 201–219. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-015-1026-2</ref>. This suggests that ethnic diversity in general reduces social cohesion and immigrants also feel these effects. On an individual level, this effect certainly varies from person to person, as research has found that those who move into a diverse place experience no negative effects on social cohesion while those who are in a community which becomes more diverse do have negative social cohesion effects<ref>Does Ethnic Diversity Have a Negative Effect on Attitudes towards the. . .. (2015, November 14). archive.is. https://archive.is/EyRQQ</ref>. This is likely due to selection bias of those moving being more likely to be sympathetic towards diverse communities. Ethnic diversity also erodes social capital<ref>In-migration and dilution of community social capital. (2018). In CES (No. 32; Vol. 18). https://www2.census.gov/ces/wp/2018/CES-WP-18-32.pdf</ref>, including the probability of volunteering, having a group membership, and the probability of entertaining<ref>Costa, D., & Kahn, M. (2001). Understanding the Decline in Social Capital, 1952-1998. https://doi.org/10.3386/w8295</ref>.

It should be noted that the largest analysis done on this subject, the aforementioned meta-estimate<ref>https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-polisci-052918-020708</ref>, found a partial correlation of -0.0256 between ethnic diversity and social trust, which translated to a 0.66% increase in the aggregate between-context unit R-square in social trust within the analysis. While it isn't a non-factor in explaining social trust, the effects are in reality very small.

Furthermore, there are important moderators to this effect, most notably multicultural and economically egalitarian policies<ref>Van Der Meer, T., & Tolsma, J. (2014). Ethnic diversity and its effects on social cohesion. Annual Review of Sociology, 40(1), 459–478. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043309</ref><ref>Kesler, C., & Bloemraad, I. (2010). Does Immigration Erode Social Capital? The Conditional Effects of Immigration-Generated Diversity on Trust, Membership, and Participation across 19 Countries, 1981–2000. Canadian Journal of Political Science, 43(2), 319–347. https://doi.org/10.1017/s0008423910000077</ref>. More contact with out-group members, which is likely related to multicultural policy, is also a notable moderator<ref>Christ, O., Schmid, K., Lolliot, S., Swart, H., Stolle, D., Tausch, N., Ramiah, A. A., Wagner, U., Vertovec, S., & Hewstone, M. (2014). Contextual effect of positive intergroup contact on outgroup prejudice. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 111(11), 3996–4000. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320901111</ref><ref>Dinesen, P. T., Schaeffer, M., & Sønderskov, K. M. (2020). Ethnic Diversity and Social Trust: A Narrative and Meta-Analytical Review.

Behavioural Public Policy, 3–2, 129–158. https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/142C913E7FA9E121277B29E994124EC5/S2398063X18000258a.pdf/contact_hypothesis_reevaluated.pdf</ref>. Not only can these effects moderate the relationship between ethnic diversity and social cohesion but in some cases they can in fact perhaps reverse it<ref>Reeskens, T. (2010). Investigating the conditional effect of Ethnic-Cultural diversity on generalized trust. In International Conference “Migration: A World in Motion.” https://migrant-integration.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2010-04/docl_13051_880029663.pdf</ref>. Still, the evidence is not completely one-way on whether moderators completely eliminate the effect of ethnic diversity on social cohesion. It appears that ethnicity can exacerbate social problems when coupled with problems such as wealth inequality, which can often occur along racial lines, but it is likely the case that even ethnic diversity alone at least in some contexts can reduce social cohesion. Neal & Neal (2014) argues that there is a tradeoff between the creation of a sense of community and a fostering of respect for diversity within neighborhoods<ref>Neal, Z. P., & Neal, J. W. (2013). The (In)compatibility of Diversity and Sense of Community. American Journal of Community Psychology, 53(1–2), 1–12. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10464-013-9608-0</ref>. These effects may not translate from a local context to a cross-national context<ref>Hooghe, M., Reeskens, T., Stolle, D., & Trappers, A. (2008). Ethnic diversity and generalized trust in Europe. Comparative Political Studies, 42(2), 198–223. https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414008325286</ref>. Furthermore, according to Saggar et al. (2012), after controlling for relative deprivation, diversity and migration have zero effect on social cohesion<ref>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/258355/social-cohesion-integration.pdf</ref>. Similarly, You (2005) finds that across countries, after controlling for societies which have fair procedural rules, fair administration of rules, as well as a relatively equal and unskewed income distribution, ethnic diversity has no effect on social trust<ref>https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2023-09/workingpaper_29.pdf</ref>.

Moving onto research about conflict, there is competing literature on the question of the relationship between ethnic diversity and conflict<ref>Ethnic polarization, potential conflict, and civil wars. (2004). In Unknown. https://www.econ.upf.edu/~reynal/aer_final_conflict.pdf</ref><ref>https://polisci.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/people/u3833/DiversityConflictandDemocracy.pdf</ref><ref>Esteban, J., Mayoral, L., & Ray, D. (2012). Ethnicity and Conflict: An Empirical study. American Economic Review, 102(4), 1310–1342. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.102.4.1310</ref>, although it varies by the measurement of diversity used. Ethnic fractionalization, which is the probability that two randomly selected people are from different ethnicities, has lesser negative effects or null effects when compared to ethnic polarization, which is how close ethnic divisions map onto a binary distribution. A related measure is an aggregate measure which takes into account ethnic distribution, effective power, and probability of across group interactions and this positively predicts conflict<ref>Kovacic, M., & Zoli, C. (2021). Ethnic distribution, effective power and conflict. Social Choice and Welfare, 57(2), 257–299. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00355-021-01317-y</ref>. In other words, the degree to which one group is in power and the degree to which ethnic exclusion occurs predicts conflict significantly, more so than other measures of ethnic diversity which only look at distribution of ethnicities without reference to relative power. Probably the most robust piece of evidence would be to look at population genetic diversity and how it relates to conflict. Arbatl et al. (2015) found that this predicts conflict across countries as well as within ethnic homelands<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21079/w21079.pdf</ref>.

This doesn't mean that in all contexts ethnic diversity will necessarily promote conflict. In areas where people recognize the need for unification as a product of ethnic differences, ethnic diversity can be the catalyst which brings about peace<ref>https://polisci.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/people/u3833/DiversityConflictandDemocracy.pdf</ref>. However, it may be the case that in other areas where this doesn't occur, it's arguably better to separate groups through physical and political boundaries to prevent conflict from occurring<ref>https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1409</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-1705-1_12</ref>. Interestingly, however, high residential mobility is another important moderator for this effect. High residential mobility has been found to result in lower levels of out-group hostility<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4672305/pdf/srep17963.pdf</ref>. In short, it appears that ethnic diversity has an inconsistent but generally positive effect on conflict between groups. Furthermore, there is research suggesting that ethnic heterogeneity increases crime<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01924036.2007.9678758</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0011128718768726</ref>.

Ethnic diversity appears to be negatively related to altruism as well, with research suggesting that ethnic diversity is associated with lower levels of charitable giving<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w17618/w17618.pdf</ref>.

Moving from a homogenous school district to one in which two racial groups have equal population shares is associated with lower school performance, holding educational spending constant<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1536-7150.2010.00721.x</ref>. Ethnic diversity also appears to increase the probability of classroom disruption in schools, although in countries with a more inclusive migration policy students are at least less harmed by the ethnic diversity effect<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03055698.2015.955750</ref>.

Finally, some research suggests that ethnic diversity has a small negative effect on birth rates, with _"one standard deviation decrease in racial concentration (having people of many different races nearby) or increase in racial isolation (being from a numerically smaller race in that area) is associated with 0.064 and 0.044 fewer children, respectively, after controlling for many other drivers of birth rates"_<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4881921</ref>. Since 1970 and 2024, the researchers estimated that the rise in racial diversity in the US explained between 20% and 44% of the decline in birth rates during that period.

So much of the research on the social effects suggests that ethnic diversity can increase conflict and decrease social trust. However, these effects appear on the whole small.

#### Economic Effects: Mixed

Looking at research on overall economic growth, the evidence points to null or negative effects of ethnic diversity on economic growth. This effect is largest in poorer countries with weak institutions and becomes null in rich democracies which have good institutions to be able to manage ethnic diversity<ref>http://www.sba.muohio.edu/davisgk/growth%20readings/1.pdf</ref><ref>https://archive.is/HSsBl</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w10313/w10313.pdf</ref>. There are some more specific lines of evidence that can be examined. One is how ethnic diversity affects institutions which predict economic growth, such as public goods provision<ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w5677</ref>, as well as other institutions which are generally positive but may not predict economic growth such as environmental protection<ref>https://archive.is/wF2el</ref>. Ethnic diversity also appears to have a negative effect on the provision of public goods.

Much of the literature on ethnic diversity and its effects in workplaces, however, is more sympathetic to diversity as a means to improve economic performance. It is conceivable from the outset that while diversity has negative effects or null effects on economic growth as a whole, there could be channels which operate either way to sway that value. Firm productivity could swing it positively, for example. Some research has suggested that ethnic diversity is positive for worker productivity and innovation<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/superdiversity-social-cohesion-and-economic-benefits</ref><ref>https://www.insurance.ca.gov/diversity/41-ISDGBD/GBDExternal/upload/McKinseyDivmatters-201501.pdf</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691615598513</ref><ref>http://www.na-businesspress.com/JBD/JBD17-3/HendersonL_17_3_.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/how-diverse-leadership-teams-boost-innovation</ref>. Additional research has suggested that racial diversity congruence with the general population has positive effects on firm productivity<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0149206315579511</ref>. However, much of the research looking at the effects of racial diversity on firm performance, was conducted by McKinsey, and the findings of this research failed to replicate<ref>https://econjwatch.org/articles/mckinsey-s-diversity-matters-delivers-wins-results-revisited</ref>. A lot of this research is thus of a questionable quality.

Furthermore, research which disaggregates ethnic diversity from associated factors which affect firm productivity, such as viewpoint diversity and diversity in education suggests that this isn't itself due to racial diversity per se but rather due to cultural differences that may themselves be correlated with racial diversity<ref>https://ftp.iza.org/dp6973.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13504851.2015.1130785</ref><ref>https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EJIM-09-2021-0474/full/html</ref>. In fact, when accounting for this, racial diversity has a negative impact on firm productivity and innovation. Further evidence for this hypothesis is how assimilation or integration, which attempts to erase cultural differences between ethnic groups, appears to reduce the productivity externalities derived from immigrant diversity, due to increased levels of cultural proximity<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00130095.2021.1897462</ref>. Another meta-analysis found that functional background diversity, and educational background diversity was positively related to innovation, while race and sex diversity were slightly negatively related to team performance<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0149206310365001</ref>.

Research which bases its conclusions on the personal experiences of employees paints a different picture, suggesting that ethnic diversity does positively affect performance<ref>https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/au/Documents/human-capital/deloitte-au-hc-diversity-inclusion-soup-0513.pdf</ref><ref>https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/about-deloitte/us-inclus-millennial-influence-120215.pdf</ref><ref>https://yello.co/blog/diversity-in-the-workplace-statistics/</ref>. It's possible that this could result in some workplaces performing better when they are diverse, merely because people believe that ethnic diversity increases productivity. What I think is more important in explaining this, however, is that people don't consider diversity to be positive because different ethnic groups are being brought together per se, but because of viewpoint diversity and educational diversity which may occur along ethnic lines. Still, there could be a degree of a placebo effect. It should be noted that diversity and inclusion initiatives aren't simply about representation but can also be associated with anti-discrimination initiatives which improve employee retention. This can result in diversity initiatives having positive effects on productivity<ref>https://www.kaporcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/TechLeavers2017.pdf</ref>. 

Given that these initiatives likely predict in many circumstances the level of ethnic diversity within firms, it is possible that this can also explain some positive overall associations between ethnic diversity and firm performance. Furthermore, this research doesn't separate between demographic and ethnic diversity necessarily.

#### Health Effects: Mixed

Ethnic diversity appears to be weakly associated with lower mental health outcomes<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266144169_Cultural_Diversity_and_Subjective_Wellbeing</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-017-0657-9</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327971738_Neighbourhood_Ethnic_Diversity_and_Mental_Health_in_Australia</ref>, and increases in own ethnic density are associated with improvements in mental health<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/abs/ethnic-density-effects-for-adult-mental-health-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis-of-international-studies/A24EC5BAF9D8B12450A940A7D3A6A887</ref><ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/ethnic-density-as-a-buffer-for-psychotic-experiences-findings-from-a-national-survey-empiric/6996920C34314755C7D02BC7C0C016FB</ref>. It should be noted however that this effect varies between individuals of different psychological orientations<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3321720</ref>. Individuals with low openness and low particularized trust tend to have lower psychological well-being as a result of immigration, which is typically associated with increases in ethnic diversity. On the other hand, immigration increases the psychological well-being of individuals with high openness and high particularized trust. In terms of general health, ethnic diversity and general health are inversely related to one another<ref>https://archive.is/UF8IT</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-016-1454-7</ref>. Additionally, ethnic diversity appears to itself contribute to poverty levels<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X17300694?via%3Dihub</ref>.

### The Effects of Interracial Marriage

I don't have any strong moral opposition to interracial relationships/marriages, although I find the sociological analysis of such relationships interesting and it is important for people to be aware of their potential consequences in case they wish to be in one.

Interracial marriages, because they go in opposition to natural ingroup bias, are naturally seen as non-normative by people. Among non-blacks there is more stigma and disapproval attached to relationships with blacks than to relationships with members of other groups<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22081799/</ref>. Furthermore, interracial couples elicit disgust and are dehumanized relative to same-race couples in general<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103116300555</ref>.

Interracial relationships also suffer from a number of issues, such as an increased likelihood of divorce or termination<ref>https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2000/demo/interracial-instability.pdf</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1741-3729.2008.00491.x</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X04000882</ref>, and increases in severe distress<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X05000438</ref>. Additionally, interracial marriage is significantly associated with higher mortality risk than same-race marriages, even after controlling for sociodemographic covariates<ref>https://paa2012.populationassociation.org/papers/122630#:~:text=Pooled%20Data%20from%201986%20to,controlling%20for%20socio%2Ddemographic%20covariates.</ref>, and generally suffer from more relationship issues <ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1037/a0025767</ref>.

These issues likely arise for two reasons. First, people are genetically inclined to choose as social partners those who resemble themselves at a genetic level<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.01574.x</ref>. Those who go against what is "normal" are more likely to not be normal in other domains, so there is probably a selection effect. Second, those who pursue interracial relationships likely have non-normative views on the world in general, which might correlate with lower relationship satisfaction, worse mental health, along with other things. Some evidence suggests that mixed-race children tend to be disproportaiontely at risk:

- Mixed race adolescents had higher risk when compared with single race adolescents on general health questions, school experience, smoking and drinking, among other risk variables<ref>https://archive.ph/dZqP1</ref>.
- US students of mixed race are more likely than others to suffer from depression, substance abuse, sleep problems, and various aches and pains<ref>https://archive.ph/Js25I</ref>.
- Those of mixed black-white ancestry fall between blacks and whites in regard to self-rated overall health and have the worst self-rated mental health<ref>https://archive.ph/0Ezku</ref>.

This is likely due to selection bias amongst those who choose to be interracial parents, as well as possible identity issues related to being mixed-race. Research on admixture and IQ suggests that outbreeding depression is not a major factor in explaining these outcomes. Similarly, there is mixed evidence on whether mixed-race children are more or less likely to have malformations from birth. Some congenital malformations are more common amongst births to parents of mixed race-ethnicity, while others are less common<ref>https://archive.ph/5kPn1</ref>.

Intuitively, it makes sense why interracial relationships will be less common. One big reason is that if one wants to preserve their own genetic heritage, they will want to have children with someone of a similar genetic mix. Race mixing probably doesn't carry significant risks on children, and depending on the context might be preferable to not race mixing depending on the partner, and is still arguably preferable for many than not having children period. Thus, from a genetics standpoint, while interracial relationships will probably always be implicitly non-normative, I don't see a strong argument for why they should be barred from occurring.

### How to Accommodate for Ethnic Diversity

Ethnic diversity can have costs to it, although things that it can be associated with, such as greater population or diverse ideas, can be beneficial. How does a multiracial society accomodate ethnic diversity despite these potential costs?

Fundamentally, there needs to be on some level a tolerance for other groups. This will involve tolerating and accepting the fact that individuals are different from one another, culturally and genetically speaking. In this type of environment, there is truth to the progressive idea that bigotry shouldn't be tolerated. While progressives have oftentimes extended what bigotry is to absurd lengths, such as suggesting that discussing race differences is inherently bigoted, there are certainly some behaviors which shouldn't be tolerated, such as racial harassment. This isn't to suggest that we should enact laws prohibiting such behaviors, but there needs to be a cultural stigma around it.

Nonetheless, it is the case that many will naturally feel a greater sense of belonging among people of their race or ethnicity. There isn't anything inherently wrong with having preferences and preferring to live around some people more than others. In recognizing this, there should be a private-public distinction made when it comes to racial preferences. A market society cannot function efficiently if there is rampant irrational taste-based discrimination present, and so that should be discouraged or outlawed if possible. But in private spheres, there isn't anything wrong with individuals who want to create ethnic-exclusive associations or the like. Racial preferences, when existent in society, should only be in the private sphere and not in the public sphere. Similarly, since every group has some level of ingroup preference on average, this right to associate should be extended to every group. There should not exist a double standard whereby, for example, black people are allowed to freely associate based on race but white people aren't.

This type of cultural and institutional arrangement I think would help to address some of the concerns many have with diversity and how it can relate to social cohesion. It means that society functions as effectively as possible with the benefits of diversity, while minimizing its costs for those who prefer in the society to want to associate mostly with people of their own ethnicity. There will certainly be edge cases, as the private-public distinction is not an especially well-defined boundary. However, bringing the distinction explicitly into public discussion will help significantly when it comes to addressing race relations.

## The Modern Narrative on Racism
  
In Canada, 40.9% of blacks reported experiencing discrimination or unfair treatment in the past 5 years due to their race or skin color, compared to 13.8% of First Nations, Metis, or Inuit, 19% of other groups designated as visible minorities, and 2.8% of non-Indigenous, non-visible minorities<ref>https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/85-002-x/2022001/article/00002/tbl/tbl01-eng.htm</ref>. While this doesn't by itself imply that racism disproportionately negatively affects one group or another, it does suggest it may be the case. But regardless, the perception of racism can have effects independent of whether that perception actually corresponds to reality. For example, perceived discrimination has a significant negative effect on both mental and physical health, also increasing stress<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747726/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24547896/</ref>.

That said, as this broad section will demonstrate, the evidence that racism is a significant issue in modern society which explains many of the disparities seen is lacking. Evidence suggests that these disparities are entirely a function of IQ differences between groups, which are largely genetic with a portion potentially being explained by historical factors such as past "racism" or meta-level cultural differences. To the extent that racism explains any of these disparities, it is a function of past actions which have proportionately little impact on the disparities today.

### The Utility of the Word "Racism"

Prior to any actual discussion of racism, it is important to discuss what it means, and whether the term has any utility. There are an infinite number of definitions of "racism" that are used, which are [continuously debated and discussed](https://prometheandissident.github.io/race/#%E2%80%9Creverse-racism-doesn%E2%80%99t-exist%E2%80%9D-or-%E2%80%9Cblack-people-can%E2%80%99t-be-racist%E2%80%9D). The reason why this occurs is because racism is seen as something evil and abhorrent, so there is an impulse to define whatever behavior you dislike under that definition, and throw any behavior you don't dislike out of that definition. This results in a definition which is extremely nebulous and fails to actually describe anything other than the person's attitude towards a behavior or system regarding how it treats race. Racism when invoked says nothing about the degree or kind of whatever is given the label. It is also effectively monopolized by those who would seek to suppress research into racial differences, something which is ultimately harmful (see [The Ethics of Investigating Race and Racial Differences](https://prometheandissident.github.io/race/#the-ethics-of-investigating-race-and-racial-differences) Thus, I don't see the word as having much use value in general discussion, and tend to avoid its usage.

However, I will make an exception here to simplicity's sake, and define racism as any unjust treatment based on race. This is an extremely vague definition, but it will become apparent that regardless of the extent of vagueness I'll still be able to analyze racial disparities and other things using this tool.

### Statistical Versus Taste-Based Discrimination

When discussing discrimination that exists in many contexts, it is important to separate between statistical and taste-based discrimination. It is most easily understood when discussing a hiring decision, although it applies in essentially all instances of discrimination. In the case of a hiring discrimination, taste-based discrimination occurs when someone chooses to hire or not hire someone based on personal dislike for their characteristics. On the other hand, statistical discrimination occurs when someone chooses to hire or not hire someone based on their belonging to a group which on average has a certain trait. In the absence of perfect information, statistical discrimination can sometimes optimize for a more productive worker. Thus, just because discrimination occurs doesn't mean it undermines productivity, although the question arises as to whether it's just and why group averages differ.

As shown prior, group averages differ in large part due to genetics on many traits, although perhaps not all. As for its morality, even if group averages were heavily or entirely environmental in origin, it may not lie in the obligation of an individual employer to not discriminate if it harm them in the process, although this may differ in other contexts or examples. This distinction will become important in discussions later where the type of discrimination will determine whether it is just. Many forms of statistical discrimination may be seen as justifiable even if it may mean judging a person based on their group average so long as it optimizes for particular outcomes, such as statistically finding the most productive person for a job.

The reality is that virtually everyone engages in certain forms of statistical discrimination all the time. The second you meet any person, you see a number of markers about them in terms of physical appearance, style, mannerisms, and more features which you infer certain things from, merely because the inference is "statistically" true. Statistical discrimination is also oftentimes done for self-protection. For example, if a woman is walking alone at night on a city street, and she has the opportunity to pick the left side of the street where there is a man walking or the right side of the street where a woman is walking, she will in many cases naturally gravitate towards the right side of the street. This is a form of statistical discrimination against the man, as there was no automatic indication that the man was necessarily a threat to the woman in the way the woman on the other side of the street was. However, because making such a decision will _on average_ increase the safety of the woman in going wherever she is going, it is not surprising that she would engage in such a behavior. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, although it could be seen as more or less justifiable depending on whether the trait used to statistically discriminate actually reflects a real signal of what is trying to be assessed, and what action is taken to engage in statistical discrimination.

#### Stereotype Accuracy

There are two major types of stereotypes which are of concern when discussing stereotype accuracy. Generic stereotypes are those which make an assertion about every member of a group. On the other hand, statistical stereotypes are those which make an assertion about group averages. Research suggests that statistical stereotypes are generally accurate and group differences are often underestimated, and have been found across race and gender lines<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-19097-002</ref>. Some statistical stereotypes are nonetheless exaggerated, such as stereotypes about adherents to political ideologies or stereotypes about national character.

There are several moderators to this effect. More educated people tend to at least hold more accurate racial stereotypes, people with a multicultural mindset tend to have more accurate stereotypes than those with a colorblind mindset, and people who are left-wing, regardless of intelligence level, tend to hold less accurate stereotypes. Inaccurate statistical stereotypes about political differences, which were exaggerated, is a major predictor of the likelihood of one to engage in political action<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-19097-002</ref>. This may be a notable cause of political divides today. So therefore, from a statistical perspective, stereotyping is perfectly rational and tends to be more common amongst those who are less left-leaning, likely due to leftists being uncomfortable with the idea of stereotyping.

Importantly, however, generic stereotypes tend to predominate the decision-making of individuals, and these tend to be cognitively simpler, are often about infrequent attributes, are based on limited statistical evidence, are not very prone to change, and are often used to generate genetic explanations where they may not necessarily exist<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313670518_Investigating_the_cognitive_structure_of_stereotypes_Generic_beliefs_about_groups_predict_social_judgments_better_than_statistical_beliefs</ref>. Therefore, it is fair to suggest that generic stereotypes are inaccurate, while statistical stereotypes are. Because generic stereotypes are employed by people more, however, we can reasonably conclude that stereotype accuracy, at least in terms of the ways in which people process stereotypes, is low. Stereotype accuracy appears to be much more complex of an issue than is generally believed. Stereotypes can be accurate or inaccurate depending on the form they manifest and also the way in which they are applied in terms of real-world behavior. Stereotyping thus is not necessarily bad. It is the utilization of a rough heuristic which can be used to effectively optimize for particular outcomes depending on the scenario, functioning as a type of statistical discrimination.

### Quantifying Bias

Attempts to quantify bias have been made, although they tend to suffer from a lack of predictive ability. The implicit association test (IAT) is the major test which aims to measure implicit biases<ref>https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.74.6.1464</ref>. This has been used primarily with regards to race, although there are equivalent tests for other biases. Implicit and explicit bias has been decreasing in general against social groups including sexual orientation, race, skin tone, age, disability, and body weight<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618813087</ref>.

Research suggests that the relationship between IAT results and explicit bias is relatively low, although a correlation exists nonetheless<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167205275613</ref>. Although it is a poor predictor of explicit bias it is a good predictor of brain activity<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0032734</ref>. Associations vary widely depending on the "mental space" the person is in. This has been shown for police officers whose results vary day to day and based on sleep<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1098611117732974</ref>.

In spite of the lack of predictive power of the IAT on individual behavior, individuals are able to predict their results on the IAT with a high degree of accuracy<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24294868/</ref>. This, along with evidence presented above, suggests that the IAT is measuring some real psychological state, even if it poorly predicts explicit behavior. While the IAT is lacking in terms of its predictive power of individual behavior, on the aggregate it has some predictive power. It doesn't appear to predict clinical decision-making<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acem.13214</ref>, but research suggests the IAT can predict system-justifying preferences of all kinds, discriminatory decision-making, political judgments and behaviors, and voting behavior<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721418797309</ref>. Implicit measures are difficult to change, so arguably it isn't fruitful to establish procedures in whatever contexts which explicitly attempt to change people's implicit biases<ref>https://psyarxiv.com/dv8tu/</ref>. Ironically, using the IAT may actually backfire on those who aim to reduce bias through its employment, as when white individuals complete a race-relevant IAT prior to an intergroup interaction, their interaction partner left the exchange feeling less positively regarded, likely due to the participants who just took the IAT adopting a cautious approach to the interaction<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22894938/</ref>. In other words, completing the IAT actually appears to reduce positive intergroup interaction behavior.

The IAT, the main way that bias is quantified, might be a somewhat useful tool for examining population differences in bias in a particular domain, but it has substantial flaws and should be used with caution.

### Unfair Bias as a Factor in Disparities

It is generally asserted that because racial disparities exist that there must be discrimination involved. But understanding group differences in cognitive ability severely undermines this narrative, because of an extremely important set of facts:

The racial disparity in wages is entirely explained by differences in skills and abilities<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/262045</ref>. In fact, not only does a lot of research suggest that the racial disparity in earnings disappears or shrinks down to an insignificant level once cognitive ability itself is controlled for <ref>https://personal.lse.ac.uk/kanazawa/pdfs/MDE2005.pdf</ref><ref>https://psyarxiv.com/qty3n/</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384250478_Does_Cognitive_Ability_Mediate_Black-White_Income_Disparities_in_the_USA</ref>, but depending on the research one looks at the returns to cognitive ability might actually be slightly higher for blacks than whites<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229357056_Occupation_and_income_related_to_psychometric_g</ref><ref>https://osf.io/6rkst/#</ref>. In fact, the racial wealth gap can be almost entirely explained by differences in observable factors, such as life cycle patterns, educational attainment, inheritance, attitudes toward saving and investing, and more<ref>https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2015/files/2015076pap.pdf</ref>.

This has MASSIVE implications for the notion that bias is a factor in group disparities. One might see this information and suggest that this only suggests that there exists no racial discrimination in economics, but this would naturally translate into other areas. Gaps in education, crime, or health naturally have effects on economics independent of intelligence which if were a product of discrimination would translate into black people having lower wages and wealth for the same IQ score. And yet we don't see this. Two major inferences can be drawn from this:

- Firstly, present discrimination is likely not a major factor driving racial disparities in general. It may play some role but it is not likely to be large. To the degree that it does exist, discrimination is likely to be rational and statistical in nature as opposed to taste-based, which is by nature irrational.

- Secondly, if discrimination is to play a big factor in disparities, it would have to be a product of factors prior to black people and white people being born, such as past discrimination. As I will show however, historical factors cannot explain present disparities to any significant degree.

Furthermore, white people appear to exhibit a significantly lower racial bias than other racial groups. As shown earlier, white people have the lowest ingroup preference of any racial group, and white liberals in fact have an outgroup preference<ref>https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/americas-white-saviors</ref>. Meta-analytic experimental research suggests that white people on net do not have any strong racial bias in favor of or against black people, while black people have a small to moderate bias in favor of black people<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168017753862</ref>. White people likely have some degree of racial bias, but this is small, and in many cases the bias may balance itself out.

To see this, imagine that there were two groups, group A and group B. Group A has twice the population, but half the bias of group B. On average, both groups will face a similar level of bias, because while the minority group has by definition fewer members, they exhibit more bias which will balance the disparity in numbers out.

It should also be noted that much of the research on racism suffers from publication bias. Due to a lack of meta-analytic data in many areas, as well as a lack of tests for publication bias even amongst research which looks at these issues, it is difficult to see how much publication bias affects particular results. However, it is consistently found that after correcting for publication bias, racial disparities go down significantly or are eliminated. Hence, one should take caution in interpreting particular studies as evidence of racism, and should generally assume that a particular study probably exaggerates the true degree of racial bias in a particular domain.

In short, evidence we have prior to investigating particular studies strongly suggests that unfair bias will not be a significant factor in particular racial disparities in outcomes, and it will at most play a relatively small role. Past circumstances might apply for some proportion of the disparity, as those could account for IQ differences that explain existing disparities, but given the evidence against environment playing a major role in these disparities, while past circumstances might explain more of the gaps in outcome than present discrimination, it is unlikely to be a significant factor either. Research investigating this issue in all domains will be discussed in turn.

#### Economic

Seeing as racial earnings gaps appear to be primarily due to differences in IQ, and hence taste-based discrimination is unlikely to account for a large amount of the gap, the information should be cross-checked with research attempting to quantify discrimination, if it occurs at all.

- **Employment Discrimination: Little to no Bias -** Meta-analytical evidence suggests that identical resumes sent to employers, with the only difference in resume being name, result in different rates of callbacks, with resumes with white-sounding names getting more callbacks than resumes with black or Latino-sounding names<ref>https://www.pnas.org/content/114/41/10870</ref><ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183X.2015.1133279?journalCode=cjms20</ref>. Some have theorized that rather than this discrimination being due to irrational biases on the part of employers, it is instead due to employers using race as a proxy for unobservable characteristics which also affect an individual's job performance beyond what is included on a resume. There is some evidence for this hypothesis being true, but it doesn't seem to account for all of the discrimination observed<ref>https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/99/2/732/5816667</ref>. For example, differences in German-speaking countries where more extensive application material is the norm and from public sector employers where application material is more standardized, there is more attention to diversity, and non-discriminatory hiring practices are often explicitly sought, suggest statistical discrimination. However, given the similar hiring decisions for immigrants of different generations, this suggests that there is also taste-based discrimination<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183X.2015.1133279?journalCode=cjms20</ref>.

- Covariates such as the inclusion of a criminal record don't appear to substantially affect the results, which one would expect to decrease the disparity if the statistical discrimination hypothesis was true<ref>https://www.pnas.org/content/114/41/10870</ref>. Some data which looks at variations in resume quality and increases in data in general also reveal a similar pattern, although this is contradicted by other evidence. This suggests there may be some statistical discrimination at play but it does not account for the totality of the explanation for the hiring gap.

- Another piece of evidence for the statistical discrimination hypothesis however is how "ban the box" policies which restrict employers from asking about applicants' criminal histories on job applications result in more discrimination happening against minorities<ref>https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/workshop/leo/leo16_starr.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/705880</ref>, suggesting that decreasing information to employers, through increasing their reliance on unobservable measures of competence in a job, increases statistical discrimination.

- It has been demonstrated that if the effect of improved productivity signals or resumes to employers on hiring is nonlinear, certain ways in which unobserved skills can be distributed between two populations can result in discrimination being shown in studies when it doesn't exist<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/2646964?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref>. Unfortunately, this may mean that none of this data definitively demonstrates the existence of racial bias in hiring, although I am intuitively skeptical of the idea that the relationship is nonlinear beyond initial requirements for a job.

- However, the actual influence this has on the results of audit studies must be very large, as evidence has suggested that with identical resumes, a black applicant without a criminal record is less likely to be called back for a job interview than a white applicant with a criminal record, in spite of the fact that a criminal record has a drastic effect on a person's probability of being employed<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/374403</ref><ref>https://www.epi.org/publication/webfeatures_snapshots_archive_09172003/</ref>. Because such an effect must be very large, without evidence in favor of an effect even being real it seems reasonable to assume that it likely at least does not eliminate all of the discrimination that is observed in the studies presented above.

- Interestingly, there is evidence suggesting that the discrimination occurring is partially class-based, as black-sounding names with a more positive socioeconomic connotation don't appear to be discriminated against<ref>https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-4/september/SocSci_v4_469to489.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2015.1114571</ref>. This doesn't disprove that unjust racial discrimination is occurring, but it does suggest that it is concentrated on the intersection between race and class.

- In response to the discrimination that minorities face in the labor market, many racial minorities attempt to make their resumes more "white" in appearance. However, when applying for jobs with employers who present themselves as valuing diversity, minorities engage less in this. Unfortunately, organizational diversity statements are not actually associated with reduced discrimination against unwhitened resumes so pro-diversity employers are actually more discriminatory in effect<ref>http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/Whitening%20MS%20R2%20Accepted.pdf</ref>.

- Overall, there appears to be some degree of hiring discrimination, which may mean that a black person on average has to submit slightly more job applications to get the same number of callbacks as a white person, although a lot of this is statistical as opposed to taste-based. This especially seems likely given that there exists ethic group differences in measures of job performance where blacks perform worse than whites, differences which are in fact larger on objective measures as opposed to subjective measures<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0021-9010.88.4.694</ref>.

- **Mortgages and Loans: No Bias -** There is evidence of mortgage discrimination occurring against blacks who have identical credit profiles, in terms of rejecting more profiles and having higher mortgage interest rates<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12552-019-09276-x</ref><ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/25764804</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/s11146-014-9473-0</ref><ref>https://ia601406.us.archive.org/32/items/cfljuly1995-95-pdf/cfljuly1995-95-pdf.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/10/blacks-and-hispanics-face-extra-challenges-in-getting-home-loans/</ref>. However, even controlling for credit score, black people are more likely to default on their mortgage/loan, meaning it makes sense to accept fewer applicants<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01099279</ref><ref>https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/creditscore/creditscore.pdf</ref>. Racial disparities in mortgage costs completely go away when accounting for differences in discount points, which black borrowers pay fewer of. On net, mortgage costs appear to be identical<ref>https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/34/2/763/5827007#226627786</ref>. Further evidence that whatever discrimination occurs is statistical discrimination comes from the fact that profits are equal or less from black borrowers compared to white borrowers, suggesting that black people are not being systematically disadvantaged from the lending policy<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/25764804</ref><ref>https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/34/2/763/5827007#226627786</ref>.

- **Rental Market: Little to no Bias -** Research suggests that there is discrimination in the rental housing market. These results are inflated by publication bias, but even after correcting for publication bias there is evidence of discrimination. Importantly however, much of this discriminatory behavior can be attributed to missing information about the social status of applicants, which suggests that much of this disparity is due to statistical discrimination<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369183X.2018.1489223</ref>. Therefore, the degree to which bias plays a role is likely small.

In short, bias plays little to no role in explaining racial gaps in economic outcomes.

#### Criminal

The degree to which the criminal justice system unfairly targets black people would have a substantial effect on the labor market outcomes of blacks relative to whites independent of cognitive ability differentials. Being unfairly targeted and thrown in prison, brutalized, etc. would have effects on the ability for blacks to get jobs and disrupt their income streams. Given our prior understanding of how blacks earn the same or more than whites of the same cognitive ability, the default hypothesis should thus be that racial bias is small to nonexistent in the criminal justice system.

The most well-researched issue regarding racial bias in the criminal justice system is the degree to which there is racial bias in police use of force. It is also the issue that is the most commonly discussed, as movements such as Black Lives Matter built themselves off of the concern that blacks were being unfairly brutalized by cops. Research on the degree to which police use of force is racially biased is mixed, possibly due to differences in methodology, or due to there being pockets of racism or lack of racism around areas studied<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12103-016-9378-y</ref>. Several pieces of information are of note however:

- A 2015 meta-analysis found that looking at studies, the aggregate effect size reveals a statistically significant effect of race on the decision to shoot a suspect. However, after controlling for publication bias, this effect COMPLETELY goes away<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12103-014-9278-y</ref>. This suggests that publication bias plays a significant role in the racial shooting bias literature.

- Meta-analytic research utilizing experimental shooting studies suggests that there is a lower shooting threshold for black targets, although this is experimental and thus may not translate into real-world behavior<ref>https://media.spokesman.com/documents/2016/05/The_Reverse_Racism_Effect.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103115000992</ref>. Furthermore, there appear to be no tests for publication bias in this research, suggesting it may overestimate the true effect in a similar way to real-world research on the subject.

- While there may be no net effect of race on the decision to shoot a suspect, this is necessarily conditional upon an encounter having occurred. If there is a differential probability of an encounter occurring in the first place that is due to racial bias, then there could still be racial bias in use of force. This is an area where intuitively it may be more likely that racial bias actually occurs, as there is naturally more procedural leeway in choosing to approach a suspect as opposed to choosing to shoot a suspect. Examining overall use of force may capture this effect. The evidence overall suggests that when accounting for the differential probability of arrest of black and white suspects there is a disparity in police use of force<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/703541</ref><ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20191028</ref><ref>https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1111/josi.12243</ref><ref>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0110-z</ref><ref>https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3660&context=faculty_scholarship</ref><ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0141854</ref><ref>https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/2330443X.2019.1704330?needAccess=true</ref>. This disparity turns anti-white when controlling for crime<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618775108</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235219304398</ref>. However, once disaggregating between armed criminals and unarmed innocent civilians, there is an anti-white bias against armed criminals and an anti-black bias against unarmed innocent civilians<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1948550620916071</ref>. There appears to be no net effect or a net anti-white effect in terms of racial bias in police use of force. However, the disaggregation results are of note.

- There is no consistent evidence suggesting that officer race substantially affects police use of force<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/puar.12956</ref><ref>https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877</ref><ref>https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1919418117</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26774/w26774.pdf</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/puar.12734</ref>. This furthermore suggests that the effect of race on officer's use of force is likely small, as in spite of the natural ingroup preference black officers would likely have which would lessen their anti-black bias or increase their anti-white bias, the net effect of officer race on decisions to shoot is too small to be consistently found across studies.

- In spite of the falsity of the narrative that there is rampant racial bias in use of force, these stories and narratives are continuously spread around in the media. Exposure to more police killings of unarmed black Americans, which as demonstrated before is in part a product of racial bias, decreases the mental health of black Americans<ref>https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31130-9/fulltext</ref>. This information is being circulated potentially at the expense of the mental health of black Americans.

So the overall research suggests that there is bias in officer's use of force, but this is heavily confounded by publication bias, and when controlling for publication bias, the effect of racial bias goes away. Unfortunately, I am not aware of any other research in the criminal justice racial bias literature which examines possible publication bias in results. Therefore, the results of particular studies in other fields of the criminal justice system should be taken with caution. This is especially because it would be extremely unlikely that racial bias would somehow appear in, for example, sentencing decisions, and yet have zero effect in police use of force. These domains likely cross over quite heavily, so there is no reason why intuitively one would expect racial bias to persist in other areas of the criminal justice system but not in police use of force. In fact, intuitively, one could make the argument that those in the police force would be the most likely to exercise racial bias, given that police probably skew more politically right, tend to value hierarchy more, and thus may have a stronger ingroup preference. The most parsimonious explanation is that at most racial bias plays a very small role in other domains of the criminal justice system.

With that being said, here is an overview of research into other domains of the criminal justice system:

- **Sentencing/Conviction: Little to no Bias -** There is considerable conflict in empirical research results examining racial bias in sentencing decisions. On aggregate, there is no statistically significant effect but using a white/non-white racial classification scheme increases the likelihood of finding a significant result. Conflict also appears to be heavily a product of methodological differences between studies<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235298000282</ref>.

- White defendants are 25% more likely than black defendants to have their initial charge dropped or reduced to a lesser crime, a disparity that goes away when comparing white and black defendants with prior convictions<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3036726</ref>. African-American prisoners convicted of murder or rape are more likely to be innocent than other convicted murderers or rapists<ref>http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Race_and_Wrongful_Convictions.pdf</ref>.

- Complaints by black and Latino citizens against white officers are less likely to be sustained, while incidents alleged by white citizens in high-crime and predominantly black neighborhoods are more likely to be sustained<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/cico.12388</ref>. Even after controlling for previous professional and judicial experience, educational background, qualification ratings, and differences in appellate panel composition, black federal district judges are consistently overturned on appeal more often than white district judges<ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/msen/files/sen_reversal.pdf</ref>.

- Black defendants are assigned greater bail levels than whites accused of similar offenses<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1990324</ref>. This overall suggests that racial bias may exist to some degree but only on the edges and not in terms of overall sentencing.

- **Arrests: Possibly Some Bias -** Blacks, males, and Hispanics are more likely to be arrested than whites, females, and non-Hispanics, even after controlling for offense seriousness, amount of evidence, whether the suspect was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, whether the suspect used a weapon, the demeanor of the suspect, and whether the suspect committed a crime in front of the officer during an encounter<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235214000890</ref>. There was little evidence of publication bias in the overall effect sizes, although it is possible that when looking at studies which use a heavy amount of controls there could be publication bias. This suggests overall that there may be some bias, although the evidence doesn't appear to be strong when taking into account other findings in other areas of the criminal justice system.

- **Traffic Stops: Little to no Bias -** Pierson et al. (2020) analyzed nearly 100 million traffic stops across the US and found that black drivers are less likely to be stopped after sunset when a veil of darkness clouds one's face<ref>https://5harad.com/papers/100M-stops.pdf?utm_source=The+Appeal&utm_campaign=3a050d7014-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_08_09_04_14_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_72df992d84-3a050d7014-58394763</ref>. This suggests bias in stop decisions. There are other studies however which have found no indication of racial bias when using a veil of darkness test<ref>https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/016214506000000168?casa_token=TyYOszQOPsAAAAAA%3Ab6D7UhNTlyYCsRYT6u-6uQOdudvgFJF89H-0l95JvtDeCTC1PFdLlfkD9MKGseeG3GUI81eW71os&#.YjKDGurMI2y</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1177/1098611111433027</ref>. Horrace & Rohlin (2016) attempts to address Grogger and Ridgeway by refining their test through controlling for streetlight locations as opposed to simply looking at daylight versus nighttime. They find that after controlling for this the odds of a black driver being stopped relative to nonblack drivers increase 15% in daylight compared to darkness, suggesting bias<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00543</ref>. Baumgartner et al. (2018) analyzed over 40 million traffic stops and found that racial disparities in traffic stop outcomes cannot be fully explained by contextual factors such as the reason why the car was pulled over, the neighborhood that the stop took place, the time of day, or the age of the vehicle, or the race of the officer<ref>https://fbaum.unc.edu/TrafficStops/Baumgartner-etal-MeasuringDisparities-20May2018.pdf</ref>. This suggests that black and hispanic drivers are subjected to harsher police behaviors than whites.

- However, the racial composition of speeders differs from that of non speeding drivers and closely approximates the racial composition of police stops, which suggests no racial profiling in traffic stops<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1080/07418820500088952</ref><ref>https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/speeding-while-black-assessing-generalizability-lange-et-als-2001</ref>. Despite this, minorities are less likely to receive a discount on their speeding tickets than white drivers<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3627809</ref>. This suggests the potential for some bias to exist in traffic stops.

- **Pedestrian Stops: Little to no Bias -** Some research suggests there exists anti-black bias in stops which persist even after controlling for crime or unlawfulness<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/016214506000001040</ref><ref>https://www.aclum.org/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/reports-black-brown-and-targeted.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.acludc.org/sites/default/files/2020_06_15_aclu_stops_report_final.pdf</ref>. This is contradicted by other research<ref>https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/213004.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR534.html</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1086/684292</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0734016816648188?journalCode=cjra</ref>. Therefore, the effect appears to be either inconsistent, small on net, or null.

- **Juries: Little to no Bias -** Mazzella & Feingold (1994) meta-analyzed experimental research on mock juror judgments and found that there was no overall effect of race on mock jurors' judgments<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1994.tb01552.x</ref>. There were no differences in punishment for robbery, assault, or rape, but jurors recommended greater punishment for blacks than for whites with negligent homicide, and for whites than for blacks on fraud. A more recent meta-analysis, Mitchell et al. (2005), found a small effect of racial bias in decision-making<ref>https://scholarworks.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1016&context=christian_meissner</ref>, but a 2014 meta-analysis, Decine & Caughlin (2014), found no net racial bias effect. There appears to be no consistent evidence that race has a significant effect on jury decisions<ref>https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Do-they-matter-A-meta-analytic-investigation-of-and-Devine-Caughlin/16101e386734fd24f0dbaaf3ae3691a002960487?p2df</ref>.

Overall, even without controls for the possibility of publication bias, which almost certainly does exist in a lot of this literature, there appears to be little evidence of any substantial degree of racial bias in the criminal justice system. This is in spite of a large-scale media apparatus actively dedicated to giving the general population the impression that rampant racism exists in our criminal justice system.

Some additional information should be noted. Each additional police officer abates approximately 0.1 homicides, effects which in per-capita terms are twice as large for black versus white victims. At the same time, larger police forces make more arrests for low-level "quality of life" offenses, which would have disproportionately burdensome effects for blacks. Thus, there is evidence that black communities are simultaneously over and under-policed<ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w28202</ref>. Police officers may do some harm in terms of enforcing lower-level offenses to the black community, in which case the cost of increased incarceration may outweigh the benefit of reduced low-level offenses, but they absolutely on net help. One homicide is abated for every 10 additional police officers that exist within a community. Police officers absolutely do more to save the lives of black people in their communities than they do to harm them. Any narrative that says otherwise is actively harmful to the black community which activists are supposedly trying to help.

**A Note on the BLM Movement**

Black Lives Matter, or BLM, is a movement which has gained popularity and aims to address alleged systemic racism in the criminal justice system. Specifically, it takes a heavy focus on publicized killings of unarmed black men by police officers. Some of the criticisms of the movement are false or exaggerated. The BLM movement has been overwhelmingly non-violent, with 94% of all BLM demonstrations being peaceful<ref>https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACLED_Report_A-Year-of-Racial-Justice-Protests_May2021.pdf</ref>. It has been violent, and it is understandable why many are uncomfortable with the idea of BLM protests coming into their communities, but the violence has been exaggerated. Additionally, contrary to the claims of some, BLM protests did not cause a rise in COVID within the areas where they were because they resulted in activities being averted which were more risky<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27408/w27408.pdf</ref>.

However, it is still fighting against an issue which doesn't really exist as demonstrated. Furthermore, it likely in fact harms the black community through promoting policing practices that increase overall homicides and increasing police attrition which has a similar effect. Research suggests that BLM protests have decreased police homicides and property crimes within the areas they are located, but have increased murders in general. However, demographic imbalance in protest variation and treatment timing warrant a cautious interpretation<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3767097</ref>. While this study is not definitive, it is consistent with previous research suggesting the benefits of policing in reducing homicides in the black community.

#### Educational

Bias in educational systems, if it exists, would likely have effects on the earnings of blacks relative to whites. As with examining economic and criminal justice disparities, the default hypothesis given prior information should be that there exists little to no bias in the educational system. Here I will look at the possibility of racial bias in school punishment and grading:

***School Punishment: No Bias -** There exists a racial gap between black and white students in suspensions, but this is completely accounted for by prior problem behavior<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235214000105</ref>.

***Grading: Little Bias -** Malouff & Thorsteinsson (2016) meta-analyzed research examining whether there exists a racial bias in grading<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0004944116664618</ref>. They found a small but statistically effect of race on grading which was robust to publication bias testing. Specifically, there was 26% of a standard deviation in score differences between students in the hypothesized-bias condition and students not in that condition. In IQ terms, this would amount to one ethnic group being assessed as being on average 4 IQ points below what they actually are. There is bias, but it is small.

In summary, there may be some bias in the education system, specifically with grading, but its actual net effect is likely to be small.

#### Health

Another question to ask is whether there is racism in health. Evidence suggests there may be some level of bias in the healthcare system, although its actual net effect on health outcomes appears difficult to ascertain. Consistent with evidence presented prior, it likely has little to no effect on actual health outcomes:

- **Healthcare Access: Some Bias -** I would have to quantify the exact effects shown in these studies, but research suggests that there exists low to moderate levels of implicit racial bias among healthcare professionals, which is significantly related to patient-provider interactions and health outcomes<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26469668/</ref><ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28249596/</ref>. Furthermore, experimental evidence suggests that there is racial discrimination against middle-class blacks compared to middle-class whites in accessing mental health care, although there is no discrimination between working-class blacks and whites<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022146516647098</ref>.

### The Possibility of Historical Factors

All of this research taken together suggests that bias today cannot explain much of the variance in outcomes between racial groups, particularly blacks and whites. However, many who theorize about systemic racism argue that it can persist even in the absence of any present bias. They use this argument by suggesting that past discrimination in the form of things such as slavery or segregation created greater disparities than would have otherwise existed, meaning that black-white income gaps can thus be attributed to racism even if there is no racism today.

One way to test whether historical factors may play a role in racial disparities is to examine the earnings of immigrants of a particular race relative to natives of that race. Villarreal & Tamborini (2018) examined the earnings assimilation of various immigrant cohorts spanning from 1980-2000. They found that within 20 years, white, Hispanic, and Asian immigrants were able to reach 90% of the earnings levels of their respective native counterparts, while black immigrants actually ended up outearning native blacks within that period of time<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6290669/</ref>. Considering that these immigrants would have endured significantly different historical factors which would have affected their economic prospects compared to natives within each racial group, the fact that their earnings in the end essentially matched those of natives of their own race implies, although not conclusively, that variance in historical factors cannot explain racial earnings differences.

Looking at specific historical factors, evidence suggests that these do not meaningfully affect modern circumstances. We can test the effect of slavery by comparing the economic and educational outcomes of former slaves and free blacks. When comparing former slaves and free blacks, it took roughly 2 generations for the descendents of slaves to catch up economically and educationally with the descendents of free black men and women<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w9227/w9227.pdf</ref>. The time frame between then and now more than allows for slavery to have zero effect on modern disparities between racial groups.

It is possible that Jim Crow laws and segregation may have inhibited economic progress. Research for example suggests that a black family's long-run economic progress after slavery depended strongly on the location they were freed. Black families freed in states with more intensive Jim Crow institutions made less economic progress after slavery<ref>https://irs.princeton.edu/events/2022/Fall-Althoff-Lukas</ref>. We can also infer this from the fact that black-white income gaps improved when things like employment discrimination were outlawed. Following the implementation of Title VII in the United States, which prohibited race-based employment discrimination, the black-white income gap narrowed from about 60% to 74% for males, and 61% to 96% for females<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w11631/w11631.pdf#:~:text=following%20the%20implementation%20of%20Title,and%20even%20narrowed</ref>. This strongly suggests that such legislation subatantially reduced the earnings gap between blacks and whites. Title VII also played a significant role in increasing black employment<ref>https://ideas.repec.org/a/uwp/jhriss/v19y1984i2p145-174.html</ref>. Further declines in the earnings gap happened after the implementation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act in 1972, which strengthened protections against employment discrimination. This came with increases in black employment shares as well<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w11631/w11631.pdf#:~:text=concludes%20from%20this%20that%20the,%E2%80%9D%20The%20evidence</ref>.

It is possible that even in the absence of discrimination, certain economic losses/inequalities created from segregation could have downstream effects today. However, given that slavery appears to have had economic effects that only lasted two generations, this implies that even if segregation was as economically damaging to a black person as slavery was, black people born today would not face any educational or economic barriers. All of this taken together suggests that historical factors such as slavery or segregation have most likely played a minimal role in modern day disparities, if anything.

It should also be noted that segregation not only harmed blacks but also probably harmed whites in the process because it inhibited economic productivity. Barriers to employment for blacks and women between 1960 and 2010 were found to significantly change the distribution of minorities in high-skilled occupations, which previously were overwhelmingly dominated by white men. This convergence in the occupational distribution as a consequence of falling barriers explains roughly 40% of aggregate growth in market GDP per person and 20% of aggregate growth in market GDP per worker<ref>https://microeconomicinsights.org/improved-allocation-of-talent-boosts-us-economic-growth/#:~:text=show%20that%20falling%20barriers%20explain,in%20market%20GDP%20per%20worker</ref>. This suggests that lowered barriers through measures such as anti-discrimination legislation actually increased economic productivity by prohibiting forms of taste-based discrimination which undermine human potential.

I am therefore in favor of antidiscrimination legislation on quasi-utilitarian grounds, although care should be taken to ensure that these types of legislation do not lead to reverse discrimination. The political scientist Richard Hanania argued in his book "The Origins of Woke" that civil rights laws paved the way for affirmative action programs through disparate impact theory, which meant that firms had to prove they weren't discriminating through engaging in reverse discrimination<ref>The Origins of Woke by Richard Hanania</ref>. How these types of laws should be enforced will have to be debated, but it is clear that some ways of enforcing nondiscrimination rules are counterproductive to the economic productivity arguments in favor of nondiscrimination laws.

### Possible Remedying of Disparities

Given that existing disparities between groups are not a function of "racism" primarily, this suggests no strong reason exists to actively remedy them. While there may be some value associated with trying to remedy them, either due to an inherent aversion to inequality even if it's natural or due to other benefits associated with remedies, these are not immediately obvious. I will discuss possible remedies of disparities, their effects so we can understand them better, and also whether they actually have good reasons for their implementation.

#### Affirmative Action

Affirmative action has a range of definitions, but is generally understood as referring ot various means by which hiring or admissions processes are changed to increase the number of minorities in institutions. This is done with the intent of equalizing group outcomes, often on the motivation that unequal group outcomes are a product of discrimination. An initial question we can examine is what the effects of affirmative action are in terms of achieving its goals:

- **In College: Effect on Minority Admissions -** The evidence suggests that affirmative action in universities has positive effects on minority admissions<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20140783</ref><ref>https://diversity.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/understanding_affrirmative_action.pdf</ref><ref>https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&u=googlescholar&id=GALE%7CA53744951&v=2.1&it=r&sid=googleScholar&asid=f46747c4</ref><ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/23261474?searchText=&searchUri=&ab_segments=&searchKey=&refreqid=fastly-default%3A9999d33bbb0ee62950e23b72868c8010#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref><ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/2962408</ref><ref>https://www.ceousa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/VALaw.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.ceousa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ASU_LAW.pdf</ref>. This effect is stronger in more elite-level schools<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/30162729.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ab5df27a45b1892b4eddfe0f728629c58&ab_segments=&origin=</ref>. This does come at the expense of some whites, but minority populations in these schools are still relatively small so this discrimination effect is relatively small as well.

- **In College: Effect on Minority Performance and Labor Market Effects -** While affirmative action undoubtedly does increase the admission of minorities into universities, there is debate about if this comes at the expense of minorities, who may suffer from being put into more difficult courses. This effect is known as mismatch. There is some research which suggests that mismatch occurs, with the most important study looking at law school affirmative action<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/40040209</ref>.
- Unfortunately, this study has the problem of presupposing in their regression models that the effect of GPA and SAT performance is uniform for races. When not looking at average effects, a different picture is painted in which prior performance is less of a predictor of future performance for black people. Moreover, the effect of school selectivity on performance is negative for the general population, but looking specifically at black people it positively predicts performance<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20140783</ref><ref>https://diversity.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/understanding_affrirmative_action.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/30162729.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ab5df27a45b1892b4eddfe0f728629c58&ab_segments=&origin=</ref>.
- The mismatch effect could still nonetheless occur for some especially unqualified black candidates. I would need to do more research before I felt confident about this issue specifically, but it is certainly possible that in the United States, affirmative action is so extreme that it is suboptimal for advancing educational outcomes for minorities<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/30162729.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ab5df27a45b1892b4eddfe0f728629c58&ab_segments=&origin=</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20962/w20962.pdf</ref>. Some research suggests still that there is a slight reduction in GPA as a result of an increase in the difference between an individual's SAT score and the institutional average, suggesting affirmative action has a negative effect on minority student outcomes<ref>https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/36853299/angel_onuoha_ec_970.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref>.
- Importantly, mismatch effects presuppose either that students' enrollment decisions are irrational or that selective universities possess private information which affects school performance. There is some evidence for the latter, meaning if we presuppose that the former assertion is true, making such information more public could decrease mismatch effects where they exist<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/QE83</ref>.
- Much of the research above on the subject suggests that the positive effects of affirmative action on minority performance translates into positive labor market effects downstream. There is some research which suggests otherwise, but this suffers from the same problem as another study mentioned before in that it assumes uniform effects of prior performance on future performance for racial groups<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2117647.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A42e0ed4c8fa818183614196a852973f5&ab_segments=&origin=</ref>.
- In short, it appears that mismatch is not an inherent feature of affirmative action programs although it can occur when such programs are sufficiently extreme. There is little evidence that affirmative action negatively impacts school performance for minorities and the overall evidence suggests it has positive labor market effects for such groups.

So affirmative action in college may achieve its expected aims in some cases, but these are benefits which are irrelevant as the initial motivating reason for having affirmative action has been shown to be flawed.

However, beyond its direct effects on minority and majority well-being, affirmative action can also have effects through how it changes the demographic makeup of an institution. Research suggests that there appears to be positive externalities derived from the increased student diversity created as a consequence of affirmative action. Most notably, it appears to improve school performance for all groups in general, meaning that affirmative action can cause boosts for non-minority students who aren't discriminated against<ref>https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/18/07/case-affirmative-action</ref><ref>https://diversity.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/understanding_affrirmative_action.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/30162729.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ab5df27a45b1892b4eddfe0f728629c58&ab_segments=&origin=</ref>. This however is likely a product of intellectual diversity as opposed to demographic diversity in itself, so if this is one's aim one should seek to directly promote intellectual diversity over demographic diversity.

**The Affirmative Action Dilemma -** Mentions of affirmative action can lead people to view groups who benefit from affirmative action more negatively<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167298241005</ref>. Affirmative action by its very nature attempts to hire or admit those who otherwise would not have had as strong of qualifications as their competitors. Such policies necessarily lead to situations whereby people will question whether any minority in their social space got their because of their merit or something else. Affirmative action to its proponents should be viewed as something positive for minorities, yet they hate the suggestion that any individual minority is a beneficiary. This is a product of the dilemma between a sacrifice of merit and an upholding of "equity".

Because of my view that disparities in outcomes between groups cannot be explained by discrimination, I am opposed to affirmative action in the form of minority quotas or preferences in hiring/admissions on the basis of race qua race.

### Separation or Integration?

When discussing separation or integration it is important to understand the various models that exist for how to deal with race in societies. There are two main models, with the latter splitting into two more, totalling three models. The first is the "multinational" model, whereby cultural pluralism and distinct forms of governance are maintained (ex. Amerindians), and the second is the "polyethnic" model which has anti-discrimination laws and pluralism in private life (ex. immigrants to western countries), with "reasonable accommodation" for differences. The polyethnic model can then be split into process-oriented (ex. Canada for the most part) or outcome-oriented (ex. Singapore)<ref>Cooperation and Social Justice by Joseph Heath, Chapter 6</ref>.

The discourse surrounding these models is rife with contradictions which prevent any goals from being achieved by parties. For example, in Canadian discourse surrounding aboriginal peoples, Amerindians who want equal outcomes are unable to achieve them in a multinational model, as achieving equal outcomes requires some level of integration between Amerindians and the rest of society. However, any attempt to move towards the alternative, a polyethnic model as was the case with the White Paper, is rejected and considered "cultural genocide". Complete cultural preservation and equality of outcome are ultimately incompatible goals which are simultaneously demanded by many within these discussions, as any disparity in outcome is presumed to be an injustice due to racism (see also: [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion](https://prometheandissident.github.io/race/#diversity,-equity,-and-inclusion)). Ironically, despite the intense stigma surrounding white nationalism, white nationalist outcomes could in theory be achieved if all other groups besides whites adopted a polyethnic model of organizing. Political separation of one group actually gets one step closer towards the goal of national separation/segregation. In other words, "all non-white groups" nationalism would achieve, to whites, the same outcomes as white nationalism. Thus, while Amerindians adopting a multinational model is viewed as acceptable, it is an exceptional case that does not apply to other groups.

The biggest counter-argument to this is that Amerindians were colonized and deserve some of their land back. Because they were in North America before Europeans or any other ethnic group, they should have a greater right to dictate who owns the land and what happens to it. However, this argument falls apart once again when looking at the acceptability of Europeans to engage in this view themselves. While many people would reluctantly suggest that if Europeans democratically voted to not allow any non-whites into their countries that we shouldn't violate the will of the people, the vast majority of people would still say that there's something immoral about doing it, despite it being their land. This points to a double-standard in how race is treated.

Furthermore, within the existence of integration there is a process-oriented versus outcome-oriented model. Process-oriented models allow for more freedom of choice and thus more cultural diversity, while outcome-oriented models, as the name suggests, aim for more equal outcomes. Ignoring the reality that disparities from the get-go are near impossible to get rid of because of genetic differences between populations, outcome-oriented models necessitate a very large degree of authoritarianism that wouldn't be politically acceptable in a country like Canada. Singapore is the primary example of an outcome-oriented model. Every citizen is assigned a race, each neighborhood has to have identical distributions of each group, and its presidency alternates among racial groups. Civic harmony is achieved by making it a punishable crime to utter words with intent to wound religious or racial feelings of others. All of these measures inhibit freedom and impose legal ordinances that would completely change how Canada operates. But without these, people will naturally gravitate towards those of a similar ethnic group (see [Ethnocentism: Descriptively and Ethically](https://prometheandissident.github.io/race/#ethnocentrism:-descriptively-and-ethically)), and will thus separate, forming and sustaining distinct cultures with distinct outcomes. Canada is utilizing a process-oriented model to try and achieve the outcomes of an outcome-oriented model, and they can't do it. Once again, there is a situation where Africans in particular want to maintain a distinct culture, and yet expect identical outcomes to exist between groups. Small forms of black separatism find themselves present in many contexts, including universities. Blacks in many cases want mentors and teachers who look like themselves, and in some cases they even want self-segregated residential dorms<ref>https://sci-hub.usualwant.com/10.1007/s12129-019-09822-4</ref>.

Many see the reason why a particular policy is one way is that there is a lack of will, but really in many cases it's simply an equilibrium of multiple counter-balancing forces pushing in two different directions. These contradictions in racial policy are an example of this <ref>Cooperation and Social Justice by Joseph Heath, Chapter 6</ref>.

My stance is that we should have one simple polyethnic and process-oriented model for all individuals. There needs to be a recognition that racial equality in terms of outcomes is not only impossible, but undesirable. There is value in having people from different places within a country to help its economic growth (see [Immigration](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#immigration)), and so while the outcome-oriented polyethnic model wouldn't work well, neither would the multinational model. The multinational model, where implemented, appears to breed resentment between groups who feel that their grievances cannot be satisfied. A polyethnic process-oriented model would allow for more cultural diversity than would exist under a polyethnic outcome-oriented model, but less so than a multinational model. On the other hand, it would allow for more equal outcomes than a multinational model, but less so than a polyethnic outcome-oriented model. While in the tradeoff this appears to be a middle ground in both dimensions, on the dimension of economic growth it almost certainly isn't.

Unfortunately, the transition to this model will be rough, as it will firstly require the abolition of multinational models in practice, most notably the reserves in North America. There will be dubious claims of cultural genocide which will be thrown around, neglecting the reality that it would be no more cultural genocide than when Europeans let non-white immigrants into their country. In this process, some transitory programs may be justifiable, such as integration initiatives in an analogous way to existing programs for immigrants to help teach language and customs to help with economic advancement and social cohesion. Such programs will be completely voluntary and will still allow for cultural pluralism, which will avoid some of the issues that existed previously with the Indian Residential School System in the past. Much of this will be smeared by bad-faith actors as "genocidal" or "white supremacist" when in reality it's simply the consistent application of existing principles we hold onto when it comes to race. Furthermore, to preserve this polyethnic model, there will need to be a cultural reckoning that equal outcomes are impossible and undesirable. This will be very difficult to convince the majority of people of, but it is ultimately necessary to do so. The first thing will be to educate people on human biodiversity to demonstrate this reality, and ideally this will help convince a sufficiently high contingent of the population to reject any attempts to engage in discrimination to achieve equal outcomes. It may be necessary for a degree of white identity politics to come into play as a rhetorical device to defend against other identity politics which aims to unjustly subvert these values, but this should be temporary and defensive in nature.

When this is achieved, economic growth will be maximized, there will be room for individuals to freely practice their own cultures, and there will be less racial resentment over separation existing ultimately.

### Accepting Racial Inequality

Given that inequality between groups is inevitable, it is crucial that societies have to accept racial inequality instead of being so resentful about it. In a similar way that some level of individual-level inequality exists and is seen as natural, and in a similar way that some level of between-family inequality exists and is seen as natural, some level of racial-level inequality will inevitably exist and ought to be seen as natural. Across many countries it is common for minority groups to outcompete majority groups. In Malaysia the Malay majority averaged less than half the income of the Chinese minority throughout the last quarter of the 20th century, even though the Chinese had no power to discriminate against the Malays and there were widespread government programs giving preferential treatment to Malays. Similarly, in Sri Lanka the Tamil minority had higher incomes than the country’s majority population, the Sinhalese, until laws and policies severely discriminating against the Tamils starting in the 1950s led the Sinhalese to overtake the Tamils in income in 1973<ref>Economic Facts and Fallacies by Thomas Sowell: Racial Facts and Fallacies</ref>. There is no society in history that has existed where all racial groups were equal in terms of outcomes, and so there should be no dogmatic expectation that modern societies would be able to perform differently.

### Debunking False Narratives

The following few sections are dedicated to discussing and debunking narratives that often crop up in the "modern narrative on racism" that are false. The reasons why they are false can be for conceptual or empirical reasons, and include ideas surrounding "reverse racism" not existing, the whole DEI notion which is completely incoherent, and the notion of "white privilege".

#### "Reverse Racism Doesn't Exist" or "Black people can't be racist"

While I generally advocate against using the word racism and think it has little utility, the underlying reasoning behind the notion of reverse racism not existing is fundamentally flawed. It firstly presupposes that racism, whatever it is, is defined such that only those with power can engage in such behavior. The problem with this is that it assumes that power is a matter of absolutes as opposed to degrees, and also assumes that all white people have power and all black people don't. Both of these assumptions are clearly wrong. Power is a question of degree, not of kind, and due to the distributions of black and white people on all sorts of traits overlapping heavily, there are many cases in which a black person will have more "power" than a white person due to their net advantages in one or more traits. This false narrative is another manifestation of the "expanding moral circle" leading to errors in judgment, errors so great that even Ibram X Kendi rejects the notion that black people can't be racist<ref>https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/22/us/kendi-book-anti-racist-blake/index.html</ref>.

#### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

DEI is an incoherent concept. It is impossible to have both diversity, differences in race, culture, etc. and equity, equal outcomes across members with those differences. The biggest reason why from a racial perspective is because genetic IQ differentials between groups prevent equal outcomes from occurring. However, beyond this diversity as it is valued by DEI advocates necessitates unequal outcomes. DEI advocates conceptualize diversity as being beneficial due to it bringing people together with different perspectives. However, those with different perspectives are going to behave differently in a variety of ways, which will naturally create differences in outcomes. Diversity hence necessitates inequity.

Advocates of DEI don't recognize this explicitly, but do implicitly. For example, they will advocate in favor of black identitarianism, suggesting that black people need to maintain their culture and should have black-only spaces to do so. They will take this in the extreme with Amerindian people, who should have access to their own ethnic-exclusive communities and even monopoly rights to casinos and the like within those areas. At the same time, if white people form their own ethnic exclusive groups, that's seen as supremacist. Ironically, the separation of every non-white group away from whites and the separartion of white people from every non-white group are both identical in outcome, but DEI advocates and the like see the former as acceptable and the latter as reprehensible.

This contradiction is certainly a function of a tunnel vision of DEI advocates, whose ideology can be boiled down to a disposition in favor of fetishizing minority groups, as opposed to being based on any actual principle. Apartheid between blacks and whites in South Africa is bad because the blacks in South Africa majority believed it was. But apartheid between Amerindians and non-Amerindians in America is good because the Amerindians in North America think it is. Unfortunately this leads to a no-win situation, where any consistent application of standards will be perceived as "racist" by DEI advocates. You're racist and evil no matter what you do, as long as it's consistent.

#### White Privilege

White privilege views being white as a categorical good in society as it confers upon one a number of unearned advantages that those of other races do not get. This has certainly been a very popular narrative in many left-wing circles, but it is flawed from an empirical and a conceptual perspective.

**The Conceptual Issues**

Whenever discussions of white privilege come up, a common line of argument comes out from those skeptical about the idea, and it goes like this:

- **White Privilege Skeptic:** "I don't think white privilege exists. I'm white and poor, how can I be privileged?"
- **White Privilege Advocate:** "White privilege means that on average, white people are advantaged, not that all white people will have advantages over every black person. Furthermore, you may be poor, but you'll never be poor because you're white. If you are poor and black however, it's often because they're black and have been discriminated against."

The advocate of white privilege when challenged on the presuppositions of the concept generally falls back on the notion that white people are only privileged on average. First, from the outset it appears intuitively extremely unlikely that there has never been any situation where a white person has been discriminated against because they are white, and hence has been harmed to some degree. So suggesting that at no point will a white person be poor or screwed over because they're white appears absurd on its face.

Furthermore, note that advocates of white privilege when talking to a particular white person will call them privileged. They're not saying that on average that white person is privileged, they're just assuming they are. Let's use an edgy and humorous example to illustrate the absurdity of this. Imagine I invent a concept called "black criminality". Whenever I talk to any particular black person, I say that they have black criminality on the part of them being black, regardless of whether they actually engaged in any criminal behavior. When called out on the fact that I'm assuming all black people are criminal with my concept, I simply assert that I'm only saying that on average black people are criminal, not that every black person is criminal. Advocates of white privilege selectively talk about the concept in terms of averages or essences whenever it is convenient for establishing a narrative. The concept is thus rendered conceptually incoherent.

**The Empirical Issues**

The empirical issue is that white people are not the most privileged group in society on any measure. In terms of income, various groups do better than whites, such as Asians<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/1085574?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref>. While some of this may be due to immigration selection bias into western countries, much of it is certainly also due to the higher mean IQ that asians tend to possess, something demonstrated in earlier sections to be in part genetic in origin. To the extent that empirically "privilege" may exist, it certainly is not whites who have it.

But furthermore, even with disparities in outcomes, that does not imply that the group with the better outcomes is privileged. If, for instance, the entirety of the white advantage in income relative to blacks is a function of mean IQ differentials which have genetic origins, this would be a difference in outcome that wouldn't be considered a "privilege", at least not a privilege in environmental conditions. Previous sections have indicated that existing disparities between groups are likely heavily a function of genes, with genes possibly causing environmental differences as well, putting into question the degree to which a white privilege could exist relative to other groups. If any disparity due to environment was considered to be a privilege, it would be a small one at best.

Because of these issues, "white privilege" should be abandoned as a term. Its linguistic usage essentializes groups in situations where essentialism doesn't apply, it ignores the existence of groups which outperform whites, and it doesn't properly account for the causes of existing disparities between groups.

### The Effect of Anti-White Racism

Much of the mainstream narrative on race concerns the existence of anti-black racism, and oftentimes even the suggestion that anti-white racism exists can be seen as a dog-whistle for some "evil agenda". However, there is evidence that anti-white racism exists to some extent, particularly amongst liberals, even white liberals. As has been discussed before several times, white liberals are the only group of people to have an outgroup preference<ref>https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/americas-white-saviors</ref>, suggesting from the outset that white liberals may engage in racism against their own ethnic group. There are numerous documented studies which empirically show that liberal racial bias exists to a fairly large extent:

- Political liberals, but not political conservatives are more censorious of anti-minority information when compared to anti-white information, and also view such information as less credible<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333677484_A_Cross-cultural_Analysis_of_Censorship_on_Campuses</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326144740_Low-status_groups_as_a_domain_of_liberal_bias</ref>. This is despite the fact that many such individuals themselves believe that they should be unbiased in their judgements.

- This appears to be due to the liberal belief in the existence of discrimination, the rejection of biological group differences, and the belief in the possibility and moral necessity of the pursuit of racial equality in society<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325033477_Equalitarianism_A_Source_of_Liberal_Bias</ref>.

- Political liberals are also more likely to endorse consequentialism when the victim in question is white rather than black, which suggests that liberals are more sensitive to sacrificing black people when compared to white people<ref>https://journal.sjdm.org/9616/jdm9616.pdf</ref>.

- Moreover, white liberals appear to be more nervous talking to minorities when compared to white people, likely due to a liberal hyper-sensitivity to racism against minority groups<ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-22158-006</ref><ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-12064-001</ref>.

- In academic decision-making, there is a favoring of blacks, in spite of people possessing implicit and explicit preferences for whites over blacks<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290510377_An_Unintentional_Robust_and_Replicable_Pro-Black_Bias_in_Social_Judgment</ref>.

- Finally, jokes against low-status groups are seen as worse by those with low system justification (who tend to be liberals) when compared to jokes against high-status groups, while there appears to be no bias by those with high system justification (who tend to be conservatives<ref>https://psyarxiv.com/qv764</ref>.

All of this information paints a picture of white liberals overcompensating for perceived racism against black people in society, by engaging in racism in the reverse direction. Much of this risks leading to censorship of true information, an inability to communicate with those of different racial groups, and a general hatred and distrust of white people. And as demonstrated before, bias is not a major explanatory factor in racial disparities we see today in things such as wealth. So to whatever extent this is justified on the basis of correcting for an existing injustice, the reality is that said injustice is not occurring to even close to the same degree as is perceived.

Much of the diversity education industry likely harms white people as well through its instilling of racial privilege ideas and increasing white guilt. White guilt is associated with belief in white privilege and belief that Europeans are perpetrators of racial discrimination<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15272965/</ref>. Furthermore, perceived racial privilege is associated with lower self-rated health and more physically and mentally unhealthy days<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23770469_Is_Perceived_Racial_Privilege_Associated_with_Health_Findings_from_the_Behavioral_Risk_Factor_Surveillance_System</ref>. Research suggests that diversity courses increase beliefs in white privilege and racism and more support for affirmative action. At the same time, white students express greater white guilt after completing such courses<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00986280701700250</ref>.

White guilt isn't necessarily a big problem now, but that doesn't mean that these types of courses don't contribute to it and thus harm white people. On average, white guilt amongst white people is low, but there is large range and variability. White guilt is associated with more negative personal evaluations of whites and theoretical antecedents of stronger beliefs in the existence of white privilege. White guilt mediates the relationship from white privilege and beliefs about the prevalence of discrimination to attitudes toward affirmative action, and both white guilt and prejudice independently predict attitudes toward affirmative action<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167299025004008</ref>.

Furthermore, education about white privilege increases anti-white bias. Social liberals show more sympathy for a poor black person than a poor white person after reading about white privilege, while for social conservatives there is no difference. However, relative to conservatives, liberals are just as sympathetic to the poor white person<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332749635_Complex_Intersections_of_Race_and_Class_Among_Social_Liberals_Learning_About_White_Privilege_Reduces_Sympathy_Increases_Blame_and_Decreases_External_Attributions_for_White_People_Struggling_With_Pover</ref>.

## Conclusion: The Unfortunate Tragedy

On a meta note, nothing discussed here from a policy perspective is particularly radical. I'm fine with multiracial societies and I suggest antidiscrimination legislation is good. The policies on which I disagree with many on, such as affirmative action and other forms of anti-white discrimination, are policies which a substantial proportion of the general population also disagrees with, and so are mainstream positions. The private-public distinction I discuss with regards to race relations, while it can seem weird at times, is actually for the most part just a codification of what already exists in practice with racial affinity groups. It is merely a logical extension of such things to being a universal doctrine.

However, the questioning of oppression narratives on the basis of race, particularly through invoking human biodiversity, is extremely controversial. I hold that the position I advocate for here, while not necessitating a hereditarian stance on issues such as race and intelligence, are most strongly justified on such a basis. It is crucial to be honest about group differences, ethnocentrism and ethnic diversity, as it is only through recognizing what is that we can figure out what is the best way that we can have cohesive, prosperous societies. The fact is that if these realities are true, and if it is the case that disparities in outcomes between groups cannot be explained by discrimination, then there is no reason to engage in policy which is based on the notion that groups are identical and interchangeable.

In the current world we live in, basically none of this can be discussed in polite conversation. It is crucial that these topics become destigmatized. How that is done is another question, and one that I cannot answer at this point.
