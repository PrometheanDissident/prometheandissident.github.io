## COVID

The COVID lockdowns had a dramatic effect in reducing transmission. Analyzing infection and death rates across 11 European nations, one study estimates that 3 million more people in those countries would have died if lockdowns had not been put in place<ref>https://www.npr.org/2020/06/09/872711012/coronavirus-lockdowns-saved-millions-of-lives-journal-nature-reports</ref>.

The COVID pandemic led to a 25 percent increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression worldwide, due to social isolation, constraints on the ability to work, and general loneliness<ref>https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide</ref>.

Research suggests that unvaccinated people are 11 times more likely to die of COVID<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/10/moderna-most-effective-covid-vaccine-studies/</ref>.

One study estimated that across 185 territories and countries, COVID vaccinations prevented 19.8 million deaths<ref>https://www.statnews.com/2022/06/23/covid19-vaccines-prevention-global-deaths/</ref>.
