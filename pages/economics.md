## On Private Ownership

One of the biggest debates that has occurred in history is whether Capitalism or Socialism is preferable. This debate has taken numerous forms, as both systems can be defined in various ways, but they are most popularly defined according to what system they use to allocate resources. Under the traditional definition of Capitalism, resources are allocated according to a market mechanism, while under the traditional definition of Socialism resources are allocated according to a central authority.

The debate on market versus central planning is exemplified in what is called the "Socialist Calculation Debate"<ref>Encyclopedia of Political Economy: Socialist Calculation Debate</ref>. Ludwig Von Mises argued that in an economy with state ownership of production, it was impossible to determine the value of capital goods and to thus achieve an efficient use of economic resources within society. Under a market mechanism, goods are valued according to prices which are determined by signals by consumers and producers. Under state planning, these signals are absent meaning that a central planner cannot properly allocate goods and services. While production might be able to be calculated for a single period of time, it could not be identified a priori and would not be able to adjust to changes in consumer or producer behavior, thus only achieving temporary efficiency at best. Oskar Lange, who advocated for using market mechanisms in state planning, suggested that this could be solved by price fixing until the equilibrium outcome is reached. But once again, this cannot solve the problem if factors are priced dynamically in the natural state.

While this "Economic Calculation Problem" or ECP as it is often called is fairly convincing, it only provides a theory for why central planning might actually be more effective. If we want more concrete evidence on the comparative merits of central planning versus market planning, we will need to look to empirical research.

### The Literature on Free Markets Versus Central Planning

The most comprehensive evidence actually comes from research utilizing "economic freedom" indices. These attempt to quantify the degree of economic freedom across countries around the world, with the most prominent index being the Heritage Foundation's Economic Freedom Index. They define economic freedom as _"the fundamental right of every human to control his or her own labor and property. In an economically free society, individuals are free to work, produce, consume, and invest in any way they please. In economically free societies, governments allow labor, capital, and goods to move freely, and refrain from coercion or constraint of liberty beyond the extent necessary to protect and maintain liberty itself"_<ref>https://www.heritage.org/index/pages/about</ref>. They measure economic freedom based on 12 quantitative and qualitative factors grouped into four groups: rule of law, government size, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. While not limited to central planning, we can take a higher level of economic freedom as generally indicative of an economy being more oriented towards market planning as opposed to central planning. Thus, research on the effects of economic freedom can be used to look at the effects of market versus central planning.

Many studies, primarily relying on the Heritage Foundation's index, have assessed the effects of economic freedom on various outcomes. A 2013 systematic literature review on the effects of economic freedom found that in the vast majority of studies that cite the economic freedom index, it is associated with mostly good outcomes<ref>https://doi.org/10.1111/coep.12010</ref>. The only main exception to this is that some of the negative studies suggested that economic freedom increases income inequality. Looking at a range of domains, we can see that economic freedom is overwhelmingly associated with positive outcomes, including higher economic growth, lower poverty, higher social mobility, greater innovation, lower unemployment, higher labor force participation and employment-population ratios, lower debt risk, higher quality of life, greater democracy, political freedom and tolerance, and lower corruption. These will be discussed in turn:

- **Economic Growth -** Doucouliagos & Ulubasoglu (2006) used meta-analytic techniques to the literature on economic freedom and economic growth and found that there is a positive association between the two<ref>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2005.06.003</ref>. Granger causality analysis suggests that for both industrial and nonindustrial countries, this is a positive feedback loop in which both variables cause one another<ref>https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.482.8647&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref>. This effect operates through a number of channels, which include low money growth rate, small role played by government enterprises, rare negative real interest rates, small difference between the official and black-market exchange rates, large size of the trade sector, and the freedom of citizens to engage in capital transactions with foreigners<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025774</ref>.

- **Poverty and Social Mobility -** Economic freedom is associated with both lower poverty<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5021345_Poverty_and_Economic_Freedom_Evidence_from_Cross-Country_Data</ref>, and increased social mobility<ref>https://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:204636/datastream/PDF/view</ref>.

- **Innovation -** Economic freedom increases innovation<ref>https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Economic-Freedom-and-Innovation-Erkan/f17a0d7f0cdc279a506b6da67eb025c73a74a721</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062976916300114</ref>.

- **Labor Markets -** Economic freedom reduces unemployment, and increases labor force participation and employment-population ratios<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/20111958?seq=1</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/coep.12031</ref>.

- **Debt Risk -** Even after controlling for a variety of factors, lower economic freedom results in a significantly higher borrowing cost for a country<ref>https://0x0.la/u/KGY9lnX.pdf</ref>.

- **Quality of Life -** Economic freedom is significantly positively associated with a multitude of indicators of quality of life<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1009068829135</ref><ref>http://journal.apee.org/index.php/2014.Fall.JPE_part5.pdf</ref>, including happiness<ref>https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/18509341.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2011/5/cj31n2-4.pdf#page=17</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X13001150?via%3Dihub</ref><ref>https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/pdf/2016/06/shsconf_rptss2016_01109.pdf</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-016-9770-9</ref>, longer life expectancy<ref>https://www.mercatus.org/students/research/working-papers/private-property-rights-economic-freedom-and-well-being</ref>, and increased health, education, and disease prevention<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X0600180X</ref>.

- **Civil Society -** Economic freedom is associated with greater democracy<ref>https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/231765996.pdf</ref>, greater political freedom<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268110000430</ref>, lower governmental corruption<ref>https://uca.edu/cahss/files/2020/07/02-Cramer-CLA-2020.pdf</ref>, a reduction in conflict<ref>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.319.4651&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref>, and greater tolerance of different groups of people<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2045577#:~:text=Regression%20analysis%20of%20up%20to,by%20how%20free%20markets%20are</ref><ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2021-01/economic-freedom-of-the-world-2020-chapter-3.pdf</ref>.

There are two exceptions to this trend of economic growth producing positive outcomes. The first is inequality, which might be greater with higher economic freedom. The second is poorer air quality, particularly with regard to carbon dioxide emissions:

- **Inequality -** Consistent with Hall & Lawson (2013), some research does suggest that economic freedom increases income inequality<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-006-9078-0</ref>, although there is no clear consensus<ref>https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1465-7287.2012.00343.x</ref><ref>https://ideas.repec.org/a/ipf/finteo/v39y2015i4p349-370.html</ref>. This is consistent with the well-known hypothesized tradeoff between equity and efficiency<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025774</ref>, in which countries with higher economic growth have to sacrifice a level of economic inequality. However, many studies which find that economic freedom increases inequality have notable caveats to it. For example, Ahmed (2017) finds that this effect is attenuated with democratic regimes, and Bauer (2016) finds that this is balanced out by an overall higher quality of life among citizens who live under conditions of higher economic freedom<ref>https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7099/5/2/18</ref><ref>https://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/honors/597/</ref>.

- **Air Quality -** Economic freedom appears to create incentives to abate local air pollution such as fine particulate matter, although such incentives do not appear to be created for carbon dioxide emissions which are more global in nature<ref>https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/economic-freedom-and-air-quality.pdf</ref>. This would make sense given the difficulty of coordination on an international scale which is required to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

This should not be seen as an unabashed endorsement of free markets in every context. Certainly, there are some contexts in which some level of regulation or even central planning may be required in an economy. This can be to address concerns about air quality, or concerns where particular policies may be harmful to things like economic growth. Just because economic freedom _in general_ is good for growth and quality of life, doesn't mean that every regulation or form of central planning is bad. It's just to say that there is a general trend of economic freedom being good, and we should keep that in mind when considering good policy.

While I think that the research on economic freedom, due to its comprehensiveness, is one of the strongest pieces of evidence to suggest that market planning is generally preferable to central planning, we can also just examine comparative research on capitalism versus socialism which does not utilize economic freedom indices. Several pieces of research/evidence strongly suggest that Capitalism and its associated legal and cultural institutions are associated with much higher economic efficiency:

- Economic institutions, such as well-specific property rights, the rule of law, economic freedom, and the quality of government, are positively related with human well-being<ref>https://college.holycross.edu/eej/Volume29/V29N1P23_40.pdf</ref>.
- Individualism is positively related to long-run growth and innovation<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176512006362</ref><ref>https://eml.berkeley.edu/~ygorodni/gorrol_culture.pdf</ref>.
- Economic freedom indicators, while having problems, still demonstrate that liberalization stimulates economic growth<ref>https://0x0.la/u/Wk50PsO.pdf</ref>.
- Socialist economies have generally underperformed relative to developed and most other developing economies<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/41770296</ref>.
- Developing countries that score better in protecting economic rights tend to grow faster, score higher in human development, and economic rights are associated with democratic government and higher levels of average national income<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02687323</ref>.
- Privately owned firms are more efficient and more profitable than otherwise comparable state-owned firms<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.39.2.321</ref>.
- Market economies tend to have more productive efficiency compared to state socialist economies<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256353073_Productive_efficiency_under_capitalism_and_state_socialism</ref>.
- Xiaogang farmers, who agreed in 1978 to have personal property and no longer have collectivization, immediately had a massive increase in their agricultural productivity. This was used as a model for the rest of the Chinese economy to move to a market system<ref>https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/01/20/145360447/the-secret-document-that-transformed-china</ref>.

There are of course exceptions to these generalities, but the general trend exists. Furthermore, examining "exceptions" to these rules often reveals that they actually prove the rule. For example, the Soviet Union initially had high economic growth due to the fact that as a developing economy it could adopt western technology while forcibly mobilizing resources to use such technology. However, once the country began to catch up with the west, it could no longer do this and its productivity diminished. In fact, various piecemeal reforms it attempted undermined its institutions and failed to improve the situation<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021716/why-ussr-collapsed-economically.asp#citation-2</ref>.

In addition to economic growth benefits, Capitalism also appears to do better in terms of quality of life:

- Low regulation and pro market attitudes have positive effects on life satisfaction<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2012.762709</ref>.
- Increases in economic freedom correspond to larger reductions of the extreme poverty rate<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20200215062544/http://myweb.fsu.edu:80/jsc07e/Documents/Papers/Connors%20-%20Economic%20Institutions%20and%20Global%20Poverty.pdf</ref>.
- There is a strong positive association between reforms towards more free markets with regard to governments' respect for human rights<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-011-9847-2</ref>.
- Capitalism does not show a preference for war<ref>https://pages.ucsd.edu/~egartzke/publications/gartzke_ajps_07-1.pdf</ref><ref>https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/public/capitalism_at_war.pdf</ref>.
- Delayed economic reform in India because of its prolonged experiment with socialism led to over ten million "missing children", amongst other negative effects on quality of life<ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/dbp4.pdf#page=7</ref>.

However, social democratic policies are also associated with higher quality of life, which implies that a mixed economy approach is most likely best for human well-being:

- In general, high democracy, strong left-wing regimes, social democratic welfare states, high public spending, fair trade policies, extensions to compulsory education provision, microfinance initiatives in low-income countries, health and safety policy, and high-quality affordable housing have positive health outcomes, while neoliberal restructuring seems to be associated with increased health inequalities and higher income inequality with lower health and mortality<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/EQUY-ACG8-X59F-AE99</ref><ref>https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305001</ref>.
- Political traditions more committed to redistributive policies and full-employment policies have generally been more successful in improving population health<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11330781/</ref>.

Unlike the economic growth example, there are actually some impressive gains that some socialist countries have made in terms of improving the quality of life of its citizens. While advocates of socialism may chalk this up to the central planning such countries engaged in, it appears that these gains were primarily a function of improvements in healthcare and education as opposed to central planning itself. For example, between 1950-1980, China experienced the most rapid sustained increase in life expectancy of any population in documented global history, and this was primarily through gains in school enrollment and public health campaigns<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00324728.2014.972432?journalCode=rpst20</ref>. These gains often came with socialist revolutions and are examples where central planning can be more effective, but nonetheless, they are not inherent to socialism and can be done in capitalistic mixed market contexts without resorting to more extreme degrees of central planning which undermine such gains.

While many discuss the presence of various market failures, from monopolies to externalities, as reasons for why government intervention is necessary, the discussion of failures of economic systems is often very one-sided. Beyond the empirical evidence showing that central planning generally fails, there are also the existence of "government failures" conceptually, which lead to central planning failing to deliver efficient results. There is the aforementioned economic calculation problem, but there are also others. For example, individual states are much less able to be held democratically accountable for the inefficient allocation of goods and services compared to a private company. Suppose that a state is tasked with providing good X. The provision of that good X is one of a large number of functions that the state would engage in. Generally, the only influence consumers would have to get the state to provide the good efficiently is via voting or some other related mechanism. But when the state is involved in providing so many other goods, voters would be unlikely to vote to change the way good X is provided when there are so many other things going on. Thus, there is less incentive for the state to efficiently provide good X. Compare this to a market, where if one firm isn't providing good X efficiently, a consumer can simply switch to another firm, giving instant feedback to both firms concerning how well they are providing that good. Thus, markets are much more incentivized to try and make consumers happy<ref>https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/economic-principles-for-prosperity.pdf</ref>.

As another example of a government failure, consider the budgeting process. The head of any government agency has every incentive to spend the entirety of their allotted budget, or have it risk getting cut in the next round of decisions, creating a "use it or lose it" mentality. Furthermore, agencies are considered more prestigious when they have more employment, so agencies will naturally spend as much money as possible employing more and more people. When a government or agency fails in its intended purpose, the primary action the agency will engage in is to call for more funding, as that damages the stability of the agency the least and ultimately gives them more power. This problem occurs in government agencies everywhere, including in high-income western nations<ref>https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/economic-principles-for-prosperity.pdf</ref>.

### The Question of Worker Ownership

Another concept of socialism which has gained more prominence in some circles is the notion of "market socialism". Not so much Lange's model which attempts to reconcile central planning with the utilization of market mechanisms, but the absence of central planning and instead direct worker ownership of production. This typically takes the form of "worker cooperatives", firms where workers generally have direct control over the company and/or have financial ownership of it. Worker ownership is primarily justified on the grounds that it increases democratic decision-making, which is argued to eliminate capitalistic exploitation and alienation. With more direct control over the means of production, capitalists are less alienated from the goods they produce, as they directly have a say in what is done with the good and how it is produced. This gives workers more control over their workplace, which is arguably the most important aspect of a person's life given the amount of time spent there by the average person.

And there is evidence to suggest that this model of organization has advantages over traditional capitalist firms. For exmaple, while codetermination laws are negatively associated with productivity, but profit-sharing, worker ownership, and worker participation in decision-making are all positively associated with productivity. All of these are stronger in labor-managed firms compared with participatory capitalist firms<ref>https://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Cooperatives/Worker_Participation_and_Productivity-Meta_Analysis.pdf</ref>. Furthermore, worker cooperatives have survival rates at least as good if not better than participatory capitalist firms<ref>https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/2020-10/worker_co-op_report.pdf</ref>. This is explained by their greater employment stability<ref>https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1016/S0885-3339(04)08001-9/full/html</ref>. Employee ownership also has a positive and statistically significant relation to firm performance<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w5277/w5277.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304459942_Employee_ownership_and_firm_performance_a_meta-analysis_Employee_ownership_a_meta-analysis</ref>. Codetermination rights lead to higher income equality<ref>https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/publications/wp/wp-147.pdf#page=4</ref>.

Using this evidence, many suggest that we should regulate the economy such that any firm over a given number of workers, such as 20, should be required to be converted into a worker cooperative. However, there are real problems which prevent worker cooperatives from ever being a universal model. In existing regulatory landscapes, it is perfectly legal to start up a worker cooperative, and many already exist in capitalist economies. The most well-known example of this is the Mondragon Corporation in Spain<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation</ref>. However, they are rare, and it is not because they are inefficient but rather because they are less likely to start up. From the ground, this is due to wealth and credit constraints, entrepreneurial rents, and collective action problems<ref>https://institute.coop/sites/default/files/resources/070%202013_Olsen_The%20Relative%20Survival%20of%20Worker%20Cooperatives%20and%20Barriers%20to%20Their%20Creation.pdf</ref>. Ultimately, worker cooperatives suffer from the traditional problems associated with public goods. Through spreading the financial risk and decision-making authority across a number of workers, it disincentivizes any individual from undertaking the needed financial and time investments to start the cooperative<ref>Encyclopedia of Political Economy: Labor-Managed Enterprises</ref>. An individual with a lot of capital would naturally be incentivized to start a business if they received all of the financial rewards that would be reaped from such an investment, but once the rewards have to be split roughly evenly between all of the employees, there is less of a financial reward to justify the investment. This especially becomes an ethical issue when considering inequalities in initial investment to the corporation. Should a person who invested their capital to start a firm really have to share the profits with a worker who didn't invest any income? Probably not.

The problems with worker cooperatives don't start there. While they can be more successful when they start up, problems begin to arise if they grow too large. As worker cooperatives grow, like all firms, management becomes a specialized function only performed by a few workers out of necessity. At a small scale, management in certain contexts might actually be easier in worker cooperatives because such firms may form egalitarian cultures that create informal modes of enforcement which don't require investment into a manager and might be more effective at creating and maintaining productive norms. However, as a firm grows larger it becomes necessary to have management be a specialized function only performed by a few individuals, a problem which applies to worker cooperatives just as much as to traditional capitalist firms. A dilemma then forms where worker cooperatives have to decide whether to impose more hierarchy that will approach traditional capitalist firms in form or to sacrifice efficiency completely. Some cooperatives attempt to get around this by rotating top management positions to ensure a more egalitarian culture is sustained, but this rarely ends up working out. As a result of this and other issues that become more difficult to manage as worker cooperatives scale, including arranging new members to buy in and retiring members to sell their shares, most cases of worker cooperatives that grow large eventually become transformed into traditional hierarchical companies or fail altogether<ref>Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology: Management, Workers’ Participation in</ref>.

Worker cooperatives tend to succeed as small firms in which most jobs are the same or can be performed by all members, where little capital is required, member motivation is at least partly ideological, the product market favors high quality over low cost products, and most employees enjoy full and equal voting rights <ref>Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology: Management, Workers’ Participation in</ref>. Many of these conditions inhibit worker cooperatives from ever becoming large-scale firms which are necessary to have in a capitalist society due to economies of scale among other reasons. Such firms can be successful in certain contexts, but it can never be adopted as a universal model. There may be a case for encouraging their use either culturally or through subsidies in certain industries, such as agriculture or grocers where they are more common as is, but ultimately this will be at most a mixed-market economy and will never amount to a "socialist" society that many advocates of such firm models envision.

## Corrupting Influence of Capitalism?

While many will concede that markets tend to be an efficient means of allocating goods and services, there are concerns raised over whether capitalism inevitably trends towards corruption and monopolies, where power eventually becomes distributed among a small number of corporations who are not meaningfully accountable to the broader population and ultimately harm society. The primary mechanism proposed for this occurring is through what is called "rent-seeking".

Rent-seeking is any practice where an entity aims to increase its wealth without making any contribution to the wealth or benefit of society. This is typically done by manipulating the political environment, such as to lobby for government-funded subsidies<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rentseeking.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20Rent%20Seeking%3F</ref>. Businesses can lobby the government for help in the areas of competition, special subsidies, grants, and tariff protection, allowing the business to achieve economic rents without any added productivity or capital at risk. Rent-seeking can cause consumers to pay more for goods and services if it increases monopoly power. It can thus create market inefficiencies and pricing disadvantages for market participants. Furthermore, rent-seeking wealth is typically a function of taxpayer funding, revenues that are used to provide economic wealth for rent seekers without necessarily benefiting the economic climate or producing any broader societal benefits<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rentseeking.asp#:~:text=,from%20lobbying%20or%20donating%20funds</ref>.

There is evidence to suggest that there is an increased level of market concentration, or a "monopolization" of industries over time in many industrialized countries. In the United States, business sector concentration is increasing, decreasing market competition. Since the late 1990s, over 75% of US industries have experienced increased corporate concentration. Rising corporate concentration in the US has coincided with increasing corporate markups and profits, weak wage growth, as well as reduced corporate investment, growth and market entry rates<ref>https://www.law.georgetown.edu/denny-center/blog/the-corporate-government-dynamic/</ref>.

One major reason why this appears to be occurring is because of nonintervention by government antitrust actors. Since the mid-1980s, mergers and acquisitions in the US have increased in number and total value, yet criminal and civil enforcement filings have fallen to historic lows, enforcement actions have not kept pace with increased filings and GDP growth, and funding for antitrust enforcement has fallen. Furthermore, technological advances that favor larger firm size, the global scope of economies of scale and the increasing value of intangible assets may all contribute to less competitive American markets<ref>https://www.law.georgetown.edu/denny-center/blog/the-corporate-government-dynamic/</ref>.

But another crucial factor involved is rent seeking, as lobbying plays an important role in American governance. Firms employ constituencies across the country that provide expertise to lawmakers in developing new policies. This can become harmful rent-seeking when corporate advocacy turns towards pursuing anti-competitive goals. This can include securing massive government contracts, passing favorable regulations, discouraging industry participation of potential competitors, and securing implicit bailout support as companies that are “too big to fail”<ref>https://www.law.georgetown.edu/denny-center/blog/the-corporate-government-dynamic/</ref>. The top 20 lobbying companies have spent more than $44 billion advocating the federal government since 1998. Corporate lobbying returns an investment of $200 for every $1 spent and increases shareholder wealth by a quarter billion dollars annually. The ten Fortune 100 companies receiving the most federal funding saw a return on investment from lobbying of $1,000 for every $1 spent<ref>https://www.law.georgetown.edu/denny-center/blog/the-corporate-government-dynamic/</ref>.

There are many corporate benefits from rent seeking and lobbying. Firms that spend more on lobbying in a given year also tend to see lower effective tax rates in the next year. For example, the 55 largest corporations, which paid $0 in federal corporate income taxes in 2020, spent $450 million on lobbying and political contributions over the last three election cycles. Additionally, firms may engage in regulatory capture, whereby government agencies prioritize the interests of the industry they are charged with overseeing at the cost of innovation, competition and the public interest<ref>https://www.law.georgetown.edu/denny-center/blog/the-corporate-government-dynamic/</ref>.

Furthermore, this behavior by firms is significantly detrimental to the general population. Through the lower wage growth and higher markup prices mentioned previously, ent-seeking contributes significantly to American income inequality through lobbying for government policies that let the wealthy and powerful get income by grabbing a larger share of the wealth than they would have earned as a reward in a free market<ref>The Price of Inequality by Joseph Stiglitz</ref>.

Does this undermine the arguments in favor of capitalism? It does suggest that there can be problems with the system, but a few points should be noted which undermine this as a reason for why socialism should be promoted:

- Corruption, while an issue within many capitalist countries, is not unique to capitalism. In fact, while the absence of policy measures such as monopoly protections can create corruption problems, as shown previously economic freedom as a whole is related to lower levels of corruption<ref>https://uca.edu/cahss/files/2020/07/02-Cramer-CLA-2020.pdf</ref>. There is no reason to assume that capitalism itself is uniquely susceptible to rent-seeking behaviors, which naturally exist when power is concentrated in any system. In fact, public choice theory may suggest that small highly focused minorities can also achieve rent-seeking outcomes in democratic societies, which implies that such issues can persist even within decentralized systems to a degree.
- There are ways to address this problem within a capitalist system through incorporating private and public transparency, monitoring and enforcement. Public investment in government staff and resources may make them less dependent on corporate input related to increasingly large and technical legislative actions. Reorienting and resourcing federal antitrust actions can also address rising corporate concentration. Furthermore, increasing coalition advocacy can also assist with preventing rent-seeking behavior<ref>https://www.law.georgetown.edu/denny-center/blog/the-corporate-government-dynamic/</ref>.
- Research also suggests that a long period of democratic rule and high per capita income are associated with less rent extraction among public policy-makers. Furthermore, a higher ratio of electorally accountable decision-makers to electorally unaccountable decision-makers, by altering voters’ evaluation of incumbent competency, changes the incentives that policy-makers who wish to remain in office have to minimize their short-term level of rent extraction in order to signal their competency and hopefully retain office. This means that countries with institutions which allow for more democratically accountable decision-makers have lower levels of rent extraction through constraining rent-seeking<ref>https://doi.org/10.1596%2F1813-9450-6305</ref>. Democratic reforms can significantly help constrain the level of rent-seeking that can persist within an economy.
- Furthermore, because high per capita income reduces the level of rent extraction, relative economic freedom through increasing economic growth can actually reduce the level of rent extraction that exists in an economy.

## The Fall of Marxism

Marxism was an incredibly influential theory that heavily shaped how the debates about free markets versus various forms of socialism, whether it be central planning or worker ownership, occurred. For its time, Marx's theories were impressive. While the labor theory of value was ultimately an idea that was shown to be false, it was merely an extension of the Classical school of political economy which was so dominant at the time, and it drew upon the theory in an intelligent way. Furthermore, the time in which the theory was developed, the 19th century, was one of immense economic turmoil, with a large number of recessions occurring which make the postwar period look mild by comparison. In those circumstances, theorizing about how the dominant system is going to inevitably fall and give rise to a different system isn't a completely irrational thing to do. However, on an intellectual as well as a political level, Marxism ultimately met its downfall. Joseph Heath points to a number of drivers explaining why Marxism declined in academic discourse<ref>https://josephheath.substack.com/p/key-stages-in-the-decline-of-academic</ref>:

- The labor theory of value was undermined because it ignored the influence of demand in determining prices, what was an important contribution that marginalist analysis made and was neglected in classical theory.
- The theory of crises that Marx had did not meaningfully explain when and why crises occurred. Keynes showed that the shortfall in demand observable during a recession was not caused by overproduction, but by a shortage of money, and was a problem of adjustment as opposed to contradictions. Marx couldn't explain basic facts of recessions such as that they were generally preceded by banking crises.
- Historical materialism couldn't anticipate or puersuasively explain the rise of nationalism in the 20th century.
- The notion of post-scarcity conditions was undermined by Veblen who pointed out that general satiation is impossible because much of our material consumption is instrumental to the attainment of outcomes that are zero-sum at the population level.
- Socialist calculation debate undermined alternatives to capitalism.

This isn't to say that Marxism has no intellectual value to it. Its points on alienation for instance likely have some merit. But ultimately, it should be seen as a product of its time, as opposed to gospel that can be used to effectively analyze a society 200 years ahead of when it was written.

## The Necessity of a Good Legal System

What is arguably as important if not more important than the broad economic system that a country employs is the quality of its legal system. Many of the requirements for an effective market economy - from the existence of private property rights to the enforcement of contracts - require a broader legal system to uphold. But beyond these immediate requirements for a market economy, a legal system needs to be unbiased so that it can preserve a "rule of law". In other words, people should not have to fear arbitrary imprisonment for vaguely defined infractions and they should be free to criticize the government without fear of punishment. In countries with a weak rule of law such as having a dependent jury or biased courts, there are substantially higher unemployment rates relative to countries with a strong rule of law<ref>https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/economic-principles-for-prosperity.pdf</ref>.

One of the big reasons why many countries around the world are poor is because they lack a strong legal system. In fact, corruption is a significant obstacle to ending extreme poverty around the world<ref>https://fpinetwork.org/2020/03/03/protestant-christianity-and-control-of-corruption-past-and-present/</ref>, and it generally has a negative effect on economic growth<ref>https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/corruption-does-sand-wheels-growth</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254443921_Corruption_and_economic_growth_A_meta-analysis_of_the_evidence_on_low-income_countries_and_beyond</ref>. The presence of legal systems which include rule of law, the protection of property rights, and the enforcement of contracts, are crucial in order for a country to begin to have substantial economic activity which can allow it to prosper.

## The Importance of Economic Growth

Many don't realize how important the level of economic growth is to the improvement of living standards. What they don't recognize is that unlike many other variables, such as inequality, growth doesn't simply change linearly but rather exponentially. Therefore, growth as a variable is incredibly important to the well-being of society.

Exponential forms of growth are difficult for people to conceptualize, as we generally weren't required to engage in such calculations. For example, suppose we had a piece of paper that we could fold in half a theoretically infinite number of times. How many times would you have to fold the peice of paper for it to be so wide that it fits the difference between the earth and the moon. One might think this would require a person to fold the paper hundreds, thousands, or even millions of times. But no, it actually only requires one to fold the paper 42 times<ref>https://www.cleverlearning.co.uk/foldingPaper.php#:~:text=Incredibly%2C%2042%20folds%20would%20make,That's%20384%2C400km.</ref>!

To tie this into economic growth, there is a general rule of thumb used to relate the growth rate of a variable with how long it takes to double in size, called the rule of 70. This rule says that the amount of time it takes for a variable to double in size is 70 divided by the growth rate. For example, if the growth rate is 1%, it would take 70 units of time, 2% would take 35, 3% would take about 23, 4% would take 17.5. Suppose we had two countries. Country A has an annual GDP growth rate of 1%, while country B has an annual GDP growth rate of 2%. In 70 years, country A's GDP would be double what it is now, but country B's GDP would have doubled twice, meaning that a simple 1 percentage point increase in the GDP growth rate caused country B to become four times wealthier than country A in less than a century. Now suppose we add a third country, country C with a GDP growth rate of 4%. This country's economy would double in size every 17.5 years, and with exponential growth this would mean that by year 70, its GDP would be 16 times larger than that of country A.

An article by Cremieux Recueil illustrates the importance of this in practice<ref>https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/rich-country-poor-country</ref>, with a diagram shown below. If the United States had a 0.25 percentage point lower GDP growth rate between 1947 and now, its economy would per-capita look like Italy's. With another 0.25 percentage points lower, it would look like Trinidad's. With another, it would look like Bosnia's. Finally, if the United States had a 1 percentage point lower GDP growth rate between 1947 and now, its economy would per-capita look like Tunisia's, where almost 10% of Tunisian children suffer from growth stunting and about 10% of the rural population lacks safe drinking water. Even tiny increases in the growth rate of a country's economy can have drastic effects on its quality of life in the long run.

But if growth is so important, how can we achieve it? As shown in the previous sections, a centrally planned economy fails to deliver economic growth, while relatively freer markets tend to. But this doesn't explain how growth can be maximized _within_ a capitalist economy, only that capitalism is the best paradigm within which we can maximize growth. Accumulation of capital and labor, while important to economic growth, can only increase linearly, and often struggle to generate increasing returns to scale on their own. Therefore, they cannot by themselves achieve high levels of economic growth. Rather, as history has consistently shown, and research has empirically demonstrated, technological progress is the main driver of long-run growth<ref>https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2015/june/what-drives-long-run-economic-growth</ref>. Therefore, the most important political instruments to maximizing economic growth in the long-run are those which maximize innovation and technology.

### Maximizing Innovation and Technology

Technology, specifically technological change, is the most important feature of the real world which influences both macro- and microeconomic processes. At a micro level, it is the key determinant of competitive success for firms and of the characteristics of competition in each industry. At a macro level, it is accepted as the most important determinant of economic growth<ref>Encyclopedia of Political Economy: Technology</ref>.

The process of innovation which creates technology is often referred to in economics as "research and development", or R&D. More specifically, R&D refers to the process undertaken by economic agents of identifying new ideas, new technology or scientific information through research, and using these ideas, technology or scientific information to develop new products, innovate production methods or solve public problems<ref>Encyclopedia of Political Economy: Research and Development</ref>.

R&D can be split into three types. The first, basic or pure research, consists of research to further scientific understanding, producing what can be considered a public good. The second type of research consists of the adaptation of available knowledge for commercial application. The third type of research and development is a hybrid of the first two, consisting of basic research undertaken to solve specific problems<ref>Encyclopedia of Political Economy: Research and Development</ref>. Basic/pure research is generally undertaken by governments, either alone or through universities as private firms are less likely to do so as a consequence of the lack of immediate profitability of such research. Nonetheless, basic/pure research is crucial to feed the technological needs of the commercial market. On the other hand, the second type of research, what could be called commercial research, is most often undertaken directly by firms, industries or entrepreneurs as it is more directly profitable and markets are better able to engage in such research. The third, a mix between the two, can be undertaken by both private and public entities.

Therefore, R&D requires the existence of a mixed market economy, where the state plays the role of engaging in general research when the private market is unable to derive profits that are immediately clear or accessible, and where the private market applies existing knowledge for commercial applications which directly benefit consumers. An example of this in practice is in the pharmaceutical industry, where contrary to claims that public R&D spending crowds out private investment and makes it more inefficient, research has instead demonstrated that public funding has generated significant returns in terms of new pharmaceutical innovations which would not have happened otherwise or would have happened at a slower rate<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c10775/c10775.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20889/w20889.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1715368115</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w20889</ref>.

A critical institution in R&D in the private sector is the existence of property rights<ref>Encyclopedia of Political Economy: Research and Development</ref>. Because firms will only engage in research that is profitable, if the knowledge derived from R&D can be immediately diffused to all firms within a market, then the firm engaging in the research will be unable to profit from the knowledge, or at least less so than in the alternative. Therefore, property rights which can potentially grant a temporary legal monopoly for the use of knowledge are essential to ensure that some types of innovation can occur in the private market. Being legally guaranteed ownership of the results of R&D, more firms will engage in it. Whether or not firms or industries decide to undertake R&D will depend on the expected rate of return from research. Property rights tend to slow down the diffusion of technology processes, or the time in which competitors can incorporate each other’s new methods into their own production processes.

Of course, there is a tradeoff to the protection of property rights regarding knowledge. Because it temporarily creates a monopoly on production of a particular good, it allows firms to mark-up the price of goods that the R&D creates, which can decrease economic efficiency. While some property rights in this context are necessary to ensure that R&D happens, if they are too strongly enforced they can create extensive monoploies which risk creating costs that outweigh the benefits.

#### Industrial Policy

Beyond a broad mixed market structure and property rights protections, there are other policies which are important to maximizing technology and innovation. One of the more direct ones is industrial policy, which involves the government directly intervening into the market to promote the development of particular industries. Types of industrial policies include subsidies, discriminatory privileges, zoning regulations and so on. Public ownership and tariffs are other examples<ref>Encyclopedia of Political Economy: Industry Policy</ref>. The motivation behind industrial policy is similar to the motivation behind the protection of property rights. Because knowledge is a public good, the benefits of it are dispersed to many agents within the economy, not simply those who undertook the process of attaining it. Therefore, in order to maximize efficiency, the government needs to step in to reduce the costs or increase the benefits associated with producing knowledge.

Research suggests that industrial policy generally has positive effects on the industries affected, whether looking at interventions to promote infant industries, public R&D, or place-based industrial policy<ref>https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/new-economics-industrial-policy#:~:text=literature%20to%20understand%20these%20complex,case%20basis%2C%20is%20called%20for</ref>. However, several challenges present themselves when it comes to the implementation of industrial policy. The first is a knowledge problem, which is related to the ["economic calculation problem"](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#on-private-ownership). While knowledge constitutes a public good which presents a market failure, and we would therefore expect that government intervention is necessary to correct the failure, what intervention is necessary, where it would be best placed, and to what degree it should be engaged in are difficult questions to answer. In some cases, industrial policy can risk artificially creating monopolies which undermine economic efficiency and well-being. The second problem occurs when this is intentionally done through rent-seeking, which evidence has shown can happen. It can be difficult to distinguish between a rent-seeking government that is beholden to special interests and a technocratic government intervening to correct market failures. Industrial policy opens up the door for the latter, but it also opens up the door for the former, which risks the policy instrument being captured by political institutions. Analysis shows that there is a high correlation between the number of industrial policy measures and political economy variables such as the presence of an upcoming election and the importance of certain products in the export basket, which suggests that governments may favor established companies for better or worse<ref>https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/04/12/industrial-policy-is-back-but-the-bar-to-get-it-right-is-high#:~:text=need%20to%20be%20well,benefit%20analysis</ref>. Thirdly, industrial policy can carry the risk of damaging cross-border spillovers in an international context. This takes the form of tit-for-tat dynamics which induce other governments to engage in industrial policy themselves, which can ultimately worsen the multilateral trading system and cause geoeconomic fragmentation<ref>https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/04/12/industrial-policy-is-back-but-the-bar-to-get-it-right-is-high#:~:text=need%20to%20be%20well,benefit%20analysis</ref>.

While industrial policy carries risks, it depends heavily on its implementation and there are extensive examples of it succeeding and failing. The biggest examples of both are the policy strategy of the Asian miracles in the late 20th century versus most developing economies in the 1960s and 1970s. The difference between the two is how they approached their industrial policy strategies<ref>https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/blog/pitfalls-of-protectionism/#:~:text=Past%20successes%20and%20failures%20of,industries%20rather%20than%20past%20ones</ref>, and can be differentiated according to whether they are engaging in export-oriented (EO) policies as the Asian miracles did, or import substition (IS) policies as most of the developing world did. EO policies deliberately attempt to leverage global competition to drive efficiency and innovation, functioning as a market signal to provide the state and firms with feedback free of protectionist distortions, as well as promoting fierce competition, spillovers to other domestic firms to adopt deeper value chain integration domestically and globally, economies of scale to boost productivity, and economic accountability whereby incentives are imposed to mitigate corruption as firmms need to compete globally to survive. This led to the Asian miracles developing at a significantly faster rate than other developing countries did, and enabled them to become global economic powerhouses<ref>https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2018/march/how-south-korea-economy-develop-quickly#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20South%20Korea%20is,23</ref><ref>https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/786661468245419348/pdf/765590JRN0WBRO00Box374378B00PUBLIC0.pdf#:~:text=Ironically%2C%20almost%20none%20of%20the,1954%29%20identified</ref>. Unlike other countries, which either adopted a snail crawl approach where they implemented a standard growth recipe that minimizes government interventions and invests in general education, or a leapfrog approach which focused on attracting FDI on top of the standard growth recipe, the Asian miracles followed more of a moonshot strategy where the state plays an active role in facilitating education and encouraging a favorable business environment through public-private partnerships. The state removed market obstacles through intervention, and businesses in turn innovated<ref>https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2019/11/13/all-the-way-to-the-top-industrial-policy-innovation-and-sustained-growth#:~:text=,promising%20roadmap%20for%20other</ref>. In contrast, most other developing economies focused on an IS strategy which favored protectionism over strengthening industry to compete with countries around the world<ref>https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/blog/pitfalls-of-protectionism/#:~:text=Past%20successes%20and%20failures%20of,industries%20rather%20than%20past%20ones</ref>. IS policies, while tending to be easier and cheaper to implement and having some short-term successes, impede growth in the long-run by inhibiting learning, economic sustainability, or lower prices. IS policies have ultimately led to inefficiency and corruption in the countries they were implemented within.

Research demonstrates that industrial policies around the world have generally been beneficial when implemented properly. By easing financing constraints and strengthening competition, industrial policy has had a positive effect on the number of patent applications made by Chinese firms<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21582440221122988#:~:text=,financing%20constraints%20and%20strengthening%20competition</ref>. Firms that receive industrial support in the form of tax holidays experience more rapid productivity growth, particularly in R&D-intensive industries and less so among politically connected firms<ref>https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/15/8/344#:~:text=We%20find%20that%20industrial%20support%2C,raises%20the%20productivity%20of%20firms</ref>. Furthermore, industrial policy can be credited with a significant amount of development of technology in the United States. During the second world war, the US government invested billions in R&D to mobilize science for war, investments which had large effects on the direction and location of US invention and on high-tech industrial employment. These effects lasted far after the war, shaping the direction of future R&D in the United States through building up local scientific and technological capabilities that allowed local innovation to thrive and jobs in associated manufacturing industries to be created<ref>https://www.nber.org/digest/sep20/world-war-ii-rd-spending-catalyzed-post-war-innovation-hubs</ref>. Industrial policies are ultimately widespread in western economies, and the fact that they exist in pretty much all of the most successful economies in history should be treated as evidence of their success<ref>https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/new-economics-industrial-policy#:~:text=literature%20to%20understand%20these%20complex,case%20basis%2C%20is%20called%20for</ref>. Ultimately, industrial policy can help to stimulate enterprises to carry out R&D and innovation behaviors and improve the innovation level of strategic emerging industries<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047462/#:~:text=innovation%20behavior%20of%20SEIs,owned%20enterprises%20is%20more</ref>, and constitute an essential means by which firms can develop, new technology can be innovated, and high economic growth can be achieved.

## The Role of Regulation

In order for an economy to succeed, it does need some degree of government regulation. But regulations carry a number of risks. While they are often justified on the idea that they improve the operation of markets, in many cases they can do the exact opposite. Regulations can increase direct out-of-pocket expenditures by businesses who have to directly satisfy requirements that they specify. Furthermore, regulations can create indirect costs known as "compliance costs". This occurs when businesses have to spend money on lawyers, accountants and other professionals to fill out the paperwork and perform other tasks to prove to the government that the businesses has fulfilled the requirements laid out by regulations. Both of these can lower business productivity and raise prices for consumers, which risks on net lowering overall economic well-being<ref>https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/economic-principles-for-prosperity.pdf</ref>.

If governments are to regulate to attempt to increase the efficiency of markets, they should be careful to ensure that the regulations are as effective as possible in producing the desired outcome. Governments should thus implement regulations that are performance or outcome based as opposed to being prescriptive. In other words, they should not tell corporations to behave in a very specific manner, but require that they fulfill some outcome. This can ensure that organizations are free to achieve the desired outcome in whichever way they wish, which will generally increase the efficiency of the process and limit the costs associated with regulations<ref>https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/economic-principles-for-prosperity.pdf</ref>.

As economic regulations have occurred in practice, they have generally had negative effects. This can be shown with empirical research looking at the overall effect of regulations. While there is certainly variation in the effects of different regulations on economic outcomes, the net effect consistently tells the story that regulation has generally speaking had a negative effect. Research suggests that regulation creates significant costs to the economy<ref>https://fee.org/articles/the-poverty-of-regulation/</ref><ref>https://www.mercatus.org/publications/regulation/cumulative-cost-regulations</ref>. Regulatory growth increases operating costs per unit of output<ref>https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/fullenbaum-regulatory-growth-mercatus-working-paper-v1.pdf</ref>. More-regulated industries experience fewer new firm births and slower employment growth. Firms may even successfully lobby government officials to increase regulations to raise their smaller rivals' costs. In fact, regulations inhibit employment growth in small firms more than in large firms<ref>https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/Bailey-Regulation-Entrepreneurship.pdf</ref>, suggesting they can increase market concentration in some cases. An increase in regulatory restrictions on a particular industry is associated with a reduction in the total number of small firms within that industry, without any association with the number of large firms in that industry<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325330609_Regulation_Entrepreneurship_and_Firm_Size</ref>. There is also a weak but positive effect of financial liberalization on growth on average<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261560612002033</ref>.

Similarly, regulation appears to negatively affect employment. Around the world, stricter regulation tends to increase unemployment. Tight hiring and firing rules and military conscription most clearly appear to have adverse effects<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596708000772</ref>. Anticompetitive business regulations such as price controls and administrative obstacles to starting a new business appear to lower labor force participation and employment rates<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148619508000337</ref>.

But beyond the negative effects on economic growth and jobs, regulations also lowers well-being as measures by poverty or life satisfaction. Research shows that regulation is associated with an increased poverty rate<ref>https://www.mercatus.org/publications/regulation/regulation-and-poverty</ref>. Regulations promote higher consumer prices, which have a disproportionately negative effect on low-income households<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-017-0479-z</ref>. Regulations tend to have regressive effects on low-wage workers, as even if their wages do not directly decrease due to regulation, their wages fall relative to those of managers and accountants in regulated industries<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-018-0517-5</ref>. Research suggests that a 10% increase in federal regulation is associated with an approximate 0.5 percent increase in income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient<ref>https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/chambers-regulation-inequality-mercatus-working-paper-v1.pdf</ref>. Finally, low regulation and pro-market attitudes have a positive effect on life satisfaction<ref>https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/13504851.2012.762709</ref>.

While regulation is good in many contexts, on the whole economies should generally aim to lower the level of regulation they have. The risks associated with regulation are often too high and research consistently shows that regulation on the whole has had a bad track record, even if in particular instances it may have been positive.

## On Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy, defined most broadly, encompasses all forms of taxation and spending that the state engages in. More narrowly, it is the use of government spending to influence economic conditions, which include the aggregate demand for goods and services, employment, inflation, and economic growth<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalpolicy.asp</ref>. Fiscal policy under this narrow definition is generally employed for the purpose of stabilizing business cycles, ensuring that the incomes of individuals aren't as uncertain as they might be otherwise. Fiscal policy can be categorized into two types based on purpose. Expansionary fiscal policy lowers tax rates or increases spending to increase aggregate demand and raise economic growth. On the other hand, contractionary fiscal policy raises tax rates or decreases spending to lower aggregate demand and lower economic growth, oftentimes with the intent to reduce inflation. The view that governments could create deficits or surpluses to affect economic activity was a particularly radical view when it was first theorized by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, as prior to that period the contemporary view was that the government budget should operate in a similar way to how a household budget operates: completely balanced<ref>https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/fiscal-policy</ref>.

Empirical research shows that expansionary fiscal policy can have a beneficial short-run effect on GDP in the context of recessions. For example, an article by the Brookings Institution shows that economic stimulus provided during the COVID pandemic in the United States led to a smaller drop in real GDP than would have occurred otherwise, although in the long-run the effect on GDP was miniscule<ref>https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-does-fiscal-policy-affect-the-level-of-gdp/</ref>. However, much of the effects are contextual on policy design. In general, studies have shown that in developed countries well-targeted fiscal stimulus can boost economic growth, particularly during recessions<ref>https://www.abacademies.org/articles/the-impact-of-fiscal-policy-on-economic-growth-a-macroeconomic-perspective-16918.html</ref>. Research across a number of OECD countries over the period of 1981-2017 shows that expansionary fiscal policies can positively and persistently affect the GDP level and crowd in business R&D investment<ref>https://academic.oup.com/icc/article/33/2/363/7591234</ref>. On the other hand, austerity in the aftermath of the great recession (or contractionary fiscal policy during an economic downturn) was associated with lower GDP, lower inflation and higher net exports. Eliminating austerity would have substantially reduced output losses in Europe. Austerity was so contractionary that debt-to-GDP ratios in some countries increased as a result of endogenous reductions in GDP and tax revenue<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304393219300959</ref>.

In developing countries, the impact of fiscal policy can be constrained by structural factors such as weak institutions and limited fiscal space<ref>https://www.abacademies.org/articles/the-impact-of-fiscal-policy-on-economic-growth-a-macroeconomic-perspective-16918.html</ref>. Oftentimes, fiscal policy can not only have beneficial impacts on growth but it can also help alleviate poverty and/or income inequality. Therefore, in some contexts, fiscal spending can be a policy measure which ignores the commonly discussed "equity-efficiency tradeoff".

One of the major concerns with fiscal policy is that if a governnment engages in too much deficit spending, it can ultimately harm long-run economic growth due to high interest payments which the country must pay. Reinhart & Rogoff (2010) found that the relationship between government debt and GDP is weak below a threshold of a 90 percent debt-to-GDP ratio. However, above that point, median growth rates of a country fall by about one percent, and average growth rates fall by even more. This threshold for public debt exists in both advanced and emerging economies<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w15639/w15639.pdf</ref>. Most studies in general find that there is a threshold after which debt begins to reduce economic growth. Of those studies, half find a threshold between 75 and 100 percent. The empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports the view that large government debt has a negative effect on the growth potential of an economy<ref>https://www.mercatus.org/research/policy-briefs/debt-and-growth-decade-studies</ref>. The concern of public debt getting too high increases during times that there are large and/or particularly severe recessions, where it may be judged as necessary to engage in fiscal policy even if a country already has a substantial level of debt. This happens with recessions in general, but is particularly acute in the case of banking crises, where research shows that government debt on average increases by 86 percent in the three years following a banking crisis<ref>https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2010/12/baldacci.htm</ref>.

In these cases, government should focus on reducing debt through reducing their government expenditures. Research suggests that debt consolidation in general is more likely to succeed when based on cuts in current expenditures. This is because curtailing spending on transfers and wages reduces pressure on nondiscretionary spending, which tends to rise over time, and may also raise growth prospects<ref>https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2010/12/baldacci.htm</ref>.

Ultimately, fiscal policy is one tool in a toolbox. From a macroeconomic perspective, expansionary fiscal policy can help a country get out of a recession quicker than they would have otherwise, and can help smooth consumption for consumers which increases their overall well-being. Nonetheless, care must be taken to ensure that expansionary fiscal policy in times of recessions is complemented by some degree of contractionary fiscal policy in times of expansions. Otherwise, a country can accumulate too much debt leading its GDP growth to suffer significantly. A decline in GDP growth is particularly bad given the way growth compounds on itself (see [The Importance of Economic Growth](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#the-importance-of-economic-growth)).

### The Tax Spread

Fiscal policy necessitates some level of taxation, as does the provision of a wide variety of goods and services which the state is generally tasked with doing. Government spending and taxation go hand in hand. But taxation comes with risks. Higher taxation means that individuals have fewer resources for consumption and investment. But beyond the level of taxation, the means by which the government raises a particular level of revenue can also have significant effects. The structure of taxation is as important to the economy as the level of taxation is.

Research consistently shows that taxation has a negative effect on economic growth. But this effect varies significantly depending on what type of taxation is examined. Generally speaking, research finds that corporate income taxes are the most harmful, followed by personal income taxes, then consumption taxes and finally property taxes. This supports the neoclassical view that income and wealth must first be produced and then consumed, so taxes on factors of production such as capital and labor are particularly disruptive to wealth creation<ref>https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/what-evidence-taxes-and-growth/</ref>.

Beyond the effects of different types of taxation on economic growth, these different types also have differential effects on inequality. Progressive tax systems mitigate income inequality<ref>https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-taxes-affect-income-inequality</ref>, but more progressive income tax systems are negatively associated with economic growth through distorting individual decisions to supply labor and invest in human capital<ref>https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2008/10/do-tax-structures-affect-aggregate-economic-growth_g17a1b64/236001777843.pdf</ref>. On the other hand, consumption taxes are neutral to saving as they tax current and future consumption equally, meaning they favor private saving more compared to income taxes<ref>https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2008/07/taxation-and-economic-growth_g17a1ad9/241216205486.pdf</ref>. Research suggests that a 1 percent shift of tax revenues from income taxes (both personal and corporate) to consumption and property taxes would increase GDP per capita by between 0.25% and 1% in the long run<ref>https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/what-evidence-taxes-and-growth/</ref>. However, consumption taxes are associated with higher income inequality<ref>https://hal.science/hal-02735145v1/document</ref>.

While comparing income versus consumption taxes implies that different tax systems often face tradeoffs between equality and efficiency, property taxes, which are the least distortive type of tax, may also be one of the more equitable tax systems. Property taxes tend to be under-utilized and generally represent a small share of tax revenue in most countries, despite being found to be the least distortive taxes for long-run economic growth. A revenue-neutral growth-oriented tax reform can be to shift part of the revenue base from income taxes to less distortive taxes, with taxes on residential property likely being the best for growth. However, these taxes are unpopular and generally levied by sub-national governments, limiting the ability for reforms to occur<ref>https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2008/07/taxation-and-economic-growth_g17a1ad9/241216205486.pdf</ref>.

Property taxation in OECD countries takes four forms: recurrent taxes on land and buildings, taxes on financial and capital transactions, taxes on net wealth and taxes on gifts and inheritances. Recurrent taxes on land and buildings have a small negative effect on economic growth, although less so than other taxes. With property taxes, the tax base is more stable meaning that the revenue generated is more predictable than for revenues generated from labor or corporate taxes, partly due to less cyclical fluctuation in property values. Furthermore, as real estate values are highly visible and immobile, property taxes can be particularly appealing when other tax bases are increasingly mobile internationally<ref>https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2008/07/taxation-and-economic-growth_g17a1ad9/241216205486.pdf</ref>.

One form of property taxation which can reduce wealth inequality is inheritance taxation. It has been argued that it leads to businesses, particularly small businesses, going bankrupt due to inheritances following taxation being insufficient to continue a business. However, heirs are generally poorer at managing businesses so inheritance taxation can help reduce skills-capital mismatch<ref>https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/inheritance-taxation-in-oecd-countries_6315055c-en</ref>. There is a moderate impact of inheritance taxes on wealth accumulation and residential choice, as well as tax planning and avoidance in general and inter vivos transfers. However, behavioral responses to an inheritance tax are smaller compared to a recurrent net wealth tax<ref>https://www.wifo.ac.at/wp-content/uploads/upload-8716/wp_2023_668_.pdf</ref>. Thus, inheritance taxation is relatively non-distortionary.

Most taxes would benefit from base broadening and rate reductions to improve efficiency<ref>https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2008/07/taxation-and-economic-growth_g17a1ad9/241216205486.pdf</ref>. Because property taxes provide more stable tax bases and are levied on immobile capital, they have the potential to broaden the base of taxation which would create this overall economic efficiency.

A big but underappreciated issue surrounding taxation is its complexity. The increasing complexity of tax systems may be harmful to growth. They result in high compliance costs that can lead to a loss of efficiency if resources are dedicated to tax compliance as opposed to productive use. Increased tax complexity is often done through anti-avoidance legislation<ref>https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2008/07/taxation-and-economic-growth_g17a1ad9/241216205486.pdf</ref>.

In short, the largest reform that could be made to increase the efficiency of the tax system is to put a greater emphasis on property taxation over other forms of taxation. It can be used in a progressive manner and it doesn't have the same level of distortionary effects as other tax systems do. Unfortunately, such a system is very politically unpopular and as such it is unlikely that this would be implemented anytime soon.

## On Monetary Policy

Monetary policy (MP) generally consists of controlling the money supply in the economy to achieve some mix of inflation and output stabilization. While in the long-run, GDP cannot be affected by monetary policy as changes in the money supply cause prices to change, due to these adjustments not occurring immediately, changes in the money supply can affect production of goods and services in the short-run. In recessions, expansionary monetary policy, increasing the money supply, can lead to a countercyclical effect where output and employment is expanded. This is generally viewed as the first line of defense in stabilizing the economy during a downturn, for the exception of countries with a fixed exchange rate where monetary policy is completely tied to the exchange rate objective<ref>https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/Series/Back-to-Basics/Monetary-Policy</ref>. Most economists think MP is best conducted by a central bank that is independent of the elected government, due to research emphasizing the problem of time inconsistency. Policymakers who were less independent of the government would have it in their interest to pursue different policy objectives at different times, which would lead to unstable inflationary expectations among consumers and businesses, making it difficult for policymakers to ever achieve low inflation. Independence would solve this problem, and research suggests that central bank independence is associated with lower and more stable inflation<ref>https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/Series/Back-to-Basics/Monetary-Policy</ref>.

Research looking at the period of 1946-2016 shows that significant contractionary and expansionary changes in monetary policy by the American Federal Reserve not taken in response to current or prospective developments in real activity have large and significant effects on unemployment, output and inflation in the expected directions<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31170/w31170.pdf</ref>. Research suggests that tight MP can reduce potential output even after a decade, while loose MP does not appear to raise long-run potential. These long-run effects develop primarily through investment decisions that ultimately result in lower productivity and lower capital stock than would be available without policy intervention. This is somewhat contrary to the notion that MP is neutral in the long-run, and this can complicate the calibration of policy<ref>https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2023/09/does-monetary-policy-have-long-run-effects/</ref>.

In the US, between 1890 and 2004 there were a total of 25 peaks and troughs in the business cycle. 12 happened in the few decades before the great depression, and 12 more happened after suggesting a moderation since then. Booms and busts can happen due to changes in the money supply or in taxes/government spending. The empirical evidence is strongly on the side of the view that deviations from full employment are often the result of spending shocks. Monetary policy in particular appears to have played a crucial role in causing business cycles in the US since WW2<ref>https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/BusinessCycles.html</ref>.

Monetary policy, like fiscal policy, is a tool in a toolbox. It is not a panacea for all problems that exist in an economy, but when effectively employed it can help to stabilize the economy, promoting quicker recovery from recessions for instance. In order for monetary policy to be implemented and implemented effectively, there needs to be a floating exchange rate to ensure that the domestic currency can freely fluctuate in value, and there needs to be central bank independence due to the aforementioned problem of time inconsistency that persists otherwise.

## On Inequality, Poverty, and Social Mobility

Inequality, poverty, and social mobility are heavily intertwined with one another. Poverty understood as relative deprivation is necessarily associated with inequality, as higher disparities between individuals in a society means that more individuals within that society are going to have deprivation relative to others. Poverty understood as absolute deprivation is also associated with inequality, as given identical median incomes a country with higher inequality will have a higher proportion of its population below any absolute poverty line relative to a country with lower inequality. However, the link between inequality and social mobility is less intuitively understood by many.

Social mobility refers to the ability of individuals to move between different income brackets, either across their lifetime or across generations. Higher social mobility means that an individual or set of individuals across generations are better able to move between various income brackets. Generally, some level of social mobility is considered desirable because it increases the capacity for an individual who started at a low socioeconomic status and yet has high innate potential to be better awarded for that potential. Research suggests that higher levels of inequality are associated with less intergenerational income mobility, as higher inequality shapes the opportunities of individuals to escape their particular income bracket. This relationship is often referred to as "The Great Gatsby Curve"<ref>https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.27.3.79#page=4</ref><ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/income-inequality-and-social-origins</ref>. But this relationship intuitively exists with poverty as well, and so it may just as easily be said that poverty is associated with less intergenerational mobility.

While social mobility can be environmentally mediated to a degree, as is shown in research on economic freedom for instance (see [The Literature on Free Markets Versus Central Planning](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#the-literature-on-free-markets-versus-central-planning)), it is well established through research that social mobility in terms of economic or social status is highly sticky, even across very long periods of time. For example, based on the analysis of surnames in England from 1170-2012, researchers have found that educational status is intergenerationally correlated at around 0.7-0.9, suggesting it is more heritable than even height. People with surnames overrepresented in the Oxbridge universities had descendants that were overrepresented centuries later<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-014-9219-y</ref>. Similar research on social status in Florence Italy found that it was very sticky intergenerationally from 1427-2011<ref>https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/88/4/1863/5958123</ref>. Other studies have found similarly high stickiness of social mobility across generations in a range of societies<ref>https://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/papers/Sweden%202012%20AUG.pdf</ref><ref>https://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/The%20Son%20Also%20Rises/Japan%202012.pdf</ref><ref>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eeh.2020.101327</ref>.

Even in the face of external shocks and perturbations, the inheritance of social status is highly stable<ref>https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/the-assimilation-myth-america?utm_source=multiple-personal-recommendations-email&utm_medium=email&triedRedirect=true</ref>:

* People sent to Gulag camps in the USSR had persistent human capital across generations<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20220231</ref>.
* Inequality before the Chinese communist revolutions persisted through such revolutions<ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/yangyou/files/revolutions_draft.pdf</ref>.
* Despite slave wealth being nullified after the US civil war, the sons of white southern households that owned slaves almost entirely recovered in wealth ranking, and their grandsons fully jumped back by 1940<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20191422</ref>. Similar findings occurred in the Danish West Indies<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498324000627</ref>.
* Sons of lottery winners do not do better in terms of wealth, income, literacy or drug consumption<ref>https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/2/687/2606947</ref><ref>https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/131/3/1455/2461173</ref>.
* Despite a vast change in social regimes and the composition of political elites, social mobility in Hungary from 1949-2017 was relatively nonexistent<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-021-00875-w</ref>.

Because social mobility is naturally very low even in situations where there are vast differences in environments across generations, the only explanation for its persistence is biological factors which are passed down from generation to generation. Most likely this takes the form of a variety of psychological traits which are heritable, such as intelligence and personality. For similar reasons, inequality between both individuals are groups is inevitable to a degree given that people differ in psychological traits which are heritable and predict socioeconomic status.

There is a common debate that concerns whether inequality actually matters. The argument for why inequality doesn't matter is generally justified on the basis that as long as everyone in a society has a minimum standard of living, it doesn't matter if some individuals are extremely wealthy while others are making it by decently but without any cool luxuries. Thus, it is not inequality that matters, but poverty.

When examining the link between inequality and crime or social cohesion, research does generally suggest that income inequality is associated with increased violent and property crime and decreased social trust<ref>https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/21/2/241/498070</ref><ref>https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-99209-003</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2523129_Inequality_And_Violent_Crime</ref><ref>https://equalitytrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/Income%20Inequality%20and%20Crime%20-%20A%20Review%20and%20Explanation%20of%20the%20Time%20series%20evidence_0.pdf</ref>. Moreover, interregional inequality increases the number of domestic terror events which occur<ref>https://www.socialcapitalgateway.org/sites/socialcapitalgateway.org/files/data/paper/2017/03/19/terrorismezcurraetal2016-regionalinequalitiesandterrorismejpe.pdf</ref>, suggesting that the effects of inequality are not limited to simple crimes. There are some notable moderators to these effects, however. Firstly, research suggests that egalitarian culture, a perception that inequality is illegitimate, moderates the relationship between inequality and crime<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1984.tb00299.x</ref>. It should be noted though that this is not an independent effect, which suggests that inequality could in fact shape this egalitarian culture.

However, the second major moderator shown in the literature is directly relevant to the debate on whether inequality matters. That is the actual poverty rate. Pridemore (2008) and Pare & Nelson (2014) both found that after controlling for poverty, inequality was unrelated to crime, whether measured by homicide, assault, robbery, burglary, or theft<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2008.00106.x</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-4446.12083</ref>. In fact, Durante (2012) found that when looking at the link between inequality and crime in the United States across the years 1981-1999, after controlling for poverty and unemployment the relationship was actually negative<ref>https://business.tcnj.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/219/2013/07/Durante-thesis-2012.pdf</ref>. In other words, higher income inequality actually predicted lower levels of crime, whether it was property or violent crime rates.

Those who suggest that inequality qua inequality matters often argue that inequality is a source of social resentment. Thus, even if everyone's well-off on an absolute level, inequality could still be bad if it led to more conflict in general. However, because research indicates that inequality after controlling for poverty is unrelated to conflict or actually predicts lower conflict, this suggests that people tend not to view inequality in itself as a large source of social resentment. Rather, individuals may become resentful of inequality if it is coupled with an absolute level of deprivation, as then there is more of a concern over whether people's needs are being met.

Much of the research linking inequality and health/subjective well-being can also be explained via this theory, especially given that none of this research controls for poverty rates. Pickett & Wilkinson (2015) reviewed the literature on the effect of income inequality on health and found that the overwhelming majority of evidence strongly suggests that it negatively impacts population health and well-being<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25577953/</ref>. These effects can range from infant mortality<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11476836/</ref> to incidence rate of schizophrenia<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4105302/pdf/nihms-599129.pdf</ref>. Economic growth is not associated with increases in happiness if it is accompanied by rising income inequality<ref>http://www.patbarclay.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2015-Oishi-et-al.-x.pdf</ref>.

Interesting, inequality could also have some niche economic benefits ignoring its impact on poverty. For example, its effect on the purchasing power of those who are of lower incomes. As income inequality increases, the market for products aimed towards the poor grows and such products become more profitable. Thus the poor will have a better purchasing power due to the increase in inferior goods provided to them<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/23809672</ref>.

I think getting away from discussions of inequality in favor of discussions around poverty would be extremely beneficial. Not only does poverty qua poverty matter, unlike inequality, but addressing poverty is a much more feasible policy goal. Given natural differences between individuals, inequalities between people will inevitably persist in any situation and along an infinite number of dimensions. However, it is feasible to guarantee everyone or nearly everyone a baseline standard of living, which is what the poverty discussion gets us towards. Inequality doesn't matter as much as people think it does beyond being linked to poverty, perhaps for the exception of political responsiveness and authoritarianism (see [The Politics of Inequality](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#the-politics-of-inequality)). This doesn't mean we should ignore research on inequality, as that can often tell us information about poverty or other important social variables indirectly, but it does mean that whenever we are examining inequality, we aren't necessarily going to care about inequality qua inequality to any substantial degree. As long as everyone has a good baseline standard of living, inequality doesn't especially matter.

### Inequality and Growth: The Equity-Efficiency Tradeoff

The equity-efficiency tradeoff is very commonly discussed in microeconomics classes, and refers to the idea that there is oftentimes a conflict between maximizing economic efficiency (or growth) and minimizing inequality in society. While this oftentimes is discussed in particular reference to social programs, in this section we will broadly examine whether economic growth and inequality are negatively related with one another. Dominici et al. (2006) and Neves et al. (2016) both employed meta-analysis to examine the effect of income inequality on economic growth<ref>https://papers.tinbergen.nl/06064.pdf</ref><ref>https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeewdevel/v_3a78_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a386-400.htm</ref>. There was a significant amount of variation in studies due to differences in methodology, differences in the effect size in countries and regions, among other factors. Cross-sectional studies typically reported a negative relationship between inequality and growth while panel studies (which take into account longitudinally) found no net effect and produced a wide diversity of results. The high levels of heterogeneity suggest that there is no clear relationship between inequality and growth and there are potentially multiple effects running in opposite directions. Nonetheless, some clear findings were discerned. Firstly, there is a stronger negative effect of inequality on economic growth for developing countries. This is likely due to in less developed countries there being more severe constraints to human capital accumulation, as well as higher political instability and social unrest. Additionally, this is likely due to richer countries having more growth-promoting aspects of inequality related to savings and incentives. Secondly, inequality has less of an effect on economic growth in the long-run. Still, it may be necessary for countries such as the US to have more inequality if it means it allows for innovation which other countries can benefit from<ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/varieties_of_capitalism_april_9_2013.pdf</ref>.

In short, there is no clear link between inequality and growth, implying that the equity-efficiency tradeoff doesn't exist generally and at best is highly situationally true. This also points to the opportunity for policies to both reduce inequality and also increase economic growth.

Political outcomes better reflect the preferences of the rich, suggesting that inequality can exacerbate differentials in political responsiveness to different income groups<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/economic-inequality-and-political-responsiveness-a-systematic-review/3364318C95A3D608048BA1800013C7E1</ref>.

### Trends in Inequality and Their Causes

<span style="background-color:orange">May need to edit</span>

As of 2020, in OECD countries income inequality is at its peak for the last 50 years. The richest 10% of the population in the income distribution possess about 50% of the entire wealth, while the bottom 40% hold just 3% of the total wealth<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9340753/#:~:text=Income%20inequality%20in%20many%20OECD,of%20the</ref>. Inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient rose in OECD countries from 0.29 in the 1980s to 0.316 in 2015. Furthermore, the average top tax rates in member nations declined from 66% in 1981 to 41% in 2008<ref>https://www.weforum.org/stories/2015/02/how-inequality-became-a-global-problem/#:~:text=inequality%20has%20grown%20within%20nations,in%20those%20years%2C%20reaching%2020</ref>.

Research on inequality suggests that both globalization and skill-biased technological change increase it<ref>https://iseak.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-rise-of-income-inequality-in-oecd-countries-2023-01-18.pdf#:~:text=technological%20change%20has%20been%20the,1998%3B%20Autor%20et%20al%2C%201998</ref>.

Trade liberalization between an industrialized country and a developing country leads to large inequality in the industrialized country in both the short-run and the long-run. In the short run, inequality is mainly driven by intersectoral wage inequality that arises due to the slow allocation of workers across industries. In the long run, inequality is driven by an increase in the skill premiums as specialization in the skill-intensive sector raises the demand for skilled workers. Taxes and transfers will  be effective in dealing with this in the short-run, but in the long run the most suitable instrument to fight inequality is a subsidy for training instruments, which reduces the skill premium by increasing the supply of skilled workers<ref>https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2015/number/6/article/trade-with-china-inequality-and-policy-responses.html#:~:text=The%20integration%20of%20China%E2%80%99s%20huge,the%20increased%20demand%20for</ref>.

Income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past two decades, both because incomes before taxes and transfers have become more unequal, and because the extent of redistribution through taxes and transfers has fallen<ref>https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2019/02/income-redistribution-across-oecd-countries_f2d12a2b/3b63e61c-en.pdf#:~:text=Since%20the%20mid,crisis%20period%20and%20was</ref>.

### The Welfare State

The welfare state, which is a system where the government actively takes efforts to engage in social spending to increase the health or well-being of its citizens, comprises the most common means that policymakers attempt to address inequality and poverty in many countries. Higher social spending is an effective means of reducing inequality and poverty, as research suggests that levels of social spending are a major predictor of cross-national rates of poverty, with higher social spending reducing poverty significantly on both absolute and relative measures<ref>http://www.lisdatacenter.org/wps/liswps/188.pdf</ref><ref>http://www2.hawaii.edu/~noy/300texts/poverty-comparative.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20070213-3.pdf</ref><ref>https://files.epi.org/2012/ib339-us-poverty-higher-safety-net-weaker.pdf</ref><ref>https://odi.org/en/publications/cash-transfers-what-does-the-evidence-say-a-rigorous-review-of-impacts-and-the-role-of-design-and-implementation-features/</ref>.

Similarly, other measures of population well-being are in general benefitted with a larger welfare state. For example, research suggests that countries with higher minimum income benefits tend to do better in terms of mortality, age standardized death rates, and life expectancy<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262230551_Welfare_states_and_population_health_The_role_of_minimum_income_benefits_for_mortality</ref><ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jbeckfield/files/beckfield_and_bambra_2016.pdf</ref>. Moreover, as welfare state generosity increases, citizens find life more rewarding<ref>https://www.academia.edu/9138840/The_Welfare_State_and_Quality_of_Life_A_Cross-National_Analysis</ref>. This is intuitively true as people with less income gain more from each dollar than people with more income, which suggests that welfare programs (which naturally decrease wealth inequality) would increase happiness<ref>https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2289&context=bclr</ref>. Furthermore, welfare, particularly food stamps, improves nutritional quality<ref>https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/13244/755330REVISED000Revised0June0402014.pdf</ref><ref>https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/Hoynes-Schanzenbach-Almond-AER-2016.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6022372/</ref>, as well as improving child physical development<ref>https://odi.org/en/publications/cash-transfers-what-does-the-evidence-say-a-rigorous-review-of-impacts-and-the-role-of-design-and-implementation-features/</ref>.

Many express a concern that welfare programs end up reducing the amount of money that goes to the poor, as it leads to less private charity spending which is more efficient in terms of redistributing income. According to this argument, higher social spending would actually increase poverty. While a crowding out effect potentially exists between welfare and charitable donations, meta-analytic evidence suggests that it is far from a 1:1 crowding out effect, suggesting there is not perfect substitution between social spending and voluntary charitable donations<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arjen-De-Wit/publication/298709903_Government_Support_and_Charitable_Donations_A_Meta-Analysis_of_the_Crowding-out_Hypothesis/links/5a6cd604a6fdcc317b17cc03/Government-Support-and-Charitable-Donations-A-Meta-Analysis-of-the-Crowding-out-Hypothesis.pdf</ref>. Ultimately, the distortionary effects of social spending on this front are limited.

Higher social spending also reduces what are often negative externalities associated with inequality and poverty, such as declining social trust and higher crime. Greater expenditures on a variety of different social programs have all been associated with significant drops in crime<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3097192</ref><ref>https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/7/10/e016379.full.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235220300623#:~:text=The%20welfare%20state%20suppresses%20crime,have%20any%20effect%20on%20homicide.</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/coep.12522</ref>. Furthermore, many countries which have high levels of social spending are known for their high levels of trust. For example, the Nordic countries are characterized by high trust, which benefits the economy and has social benefits. This is in part due to their welfare state and education<ref>https://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1095959/FULLTEXT02.pdf</ref>.

The largest concern that comes with a welfare state is that it reduces economic efficiency. The main reason suggested for this happening is that it reduces the incentives for individuals to work. The effects of social spending on employment are mixed but generally there is a small or null effect<ref>https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/95374/1/472529528.pdf</ref><ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-012-0458-0</ref><ref>https://odi.org/en/publications/cash-transfers-what-does-the-evidence-say-a-rigorous-review-of-impacts-and-the-role-of-design-and-implementation-features/</ref><ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/remahanna/files/151016_labor_supply_paper_draft_final.pdf</ref>. Welfare recipients have no differences in attitudes or political beliefs compared to non-recipients, suggesting that there is no culture of dependence that is developed from being on welfare<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/4092339?mag=welfare-dependency&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref>. Furthermore, employment commitment appears to increase in more generous welfare states<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0950017014542499</ref><ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/26499235</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150331074345.htm</ref>. While the work concern isn't completely unfounded, the actual net effect of welfare on work tends to be small.

Research on the effects of social spending on aggregate economic growth similarly corroborate this. The effects of social spending on economic growth are mixed and highly heterogeneous depending on which studies are looked at<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/056943459604000202</ref>. Tomassi (2013) suggests that the level of social spending alone is not sufficient to determine the impact on economic performance, but how the welfare system is designed and structured<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293824842_When_is_social_protection_productivity-enhancing_Costs_and_benefits_on_economic_performances</ref>. Furceri & Zdzienicka (2012) found a short-term multiplier effect of social spending on economic activity<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-5890.2012.00155.x</ref>, but Churchill & Yew (2017) did a meta-analysis and found that government transfers are more detrimental to economic growth in developed countries as opposed to less-developed countries<ref>https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecmode/v64y2017icp270-287.html</ref>. Part of the effect may be due to whether it is looking from a short-term versus long-term perspective. Social welfare schemes may be good in economic downturns (see [On Fiscal Policy](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#on-fiscal-policy)).

This certainly isn't to suggest that we can infinitely engage in social spending and it will always be beneficial with little detrimental effects to economic growth. Too much social spending can put a heavy burden on a country's budget. For example, the Scandinavian model, which peaked in the late 20th century, had a very high supply of public goods that were provided irrespective of income. This had to be financed, leading to high marginal income tax rates of 70-80%, but also left the public system to be financially fragile. Denmark and Sweden, two countries falling under the model, experienced large budget deficits in the early 1980s and 1990s respectively<ref>Encyclopedia of Political Economy: Scandinavian Model</ref>, and the most quintessential country in the Scandinavian model, Sweden, eventually began rolling back the model<ref>Encyclopedia of Political Economy: Welfare State</ref>. This was done through, among other things, lower social spending and tax cuts, which have ultimately led many to question whether the Scandinavian model is obsolete.

With high heterogeneity in the effects of social spending on economic growth however provides the opportunity for some social spending to generate positive economic returns. Research looking at this often examines the marginal value of public funds (MVPF) of various forms of social spending. Research suggests that the MVPF is highest in direct investments on low-income children, including child health insurance expansions and college policies. In other words, these tend to pay for themselves. For policies targeting adults, they tend to involve budgetary tradeoffs as they cost the government on net. Expenditures on adults can have high MVPFs if they have spillover effects on children<ref>https://www.policyinsights.org/</ref>. This research provides areas where social spending can not only address economic inequality/poverty, but also guarantee higher economic growth in the process.

Another concern that arises is how social spending affects the family. In other words, does it have disruptive effects? Most studies looking at the United States suggest that welfare has a negative effect on marriage and a positive effect on fertility<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230345/</ref>, although a notable minority of studies find no relation at all and there is significant variation in findings. However, research looking at OECD member countries in general suggests that an expansion in the welfare state, while increasing fertility, also increases marriage and divorce rates with a stronger effect on marriage, suggesting that welfare states support family formation<ref>https://ftp.iza.org/dp7210.pdf</ref>. This may be due to the structure of the American welfare system, as for example in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program there is a requirement that the program provides cash support only to children living without at least one of their biological parents. Medicaid has historically been made available primarily to AFDC recipients and housing programs also tend to have preferences for AFDC recipients, thus having the same bias toward single-parent families<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230345/</ref>. The American Food Stamp Program (FSP), which did not have the same bias toward single-parent families, was found to improve birth outcomes amongst those who were exposed to the program three months before birth<ref>https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/93/2/387/58599/Inside-the-War-on-Poverty-The-Impact-of-Food</ref>. In sum, welfare does not necessarily have negative familial effects but can in fact promote family creation. However, if eligibility requirements for benefits include familial structure, as was the case in the United States, it can have negative familial effects.

#### The Universality Question

Perhaps the largest debate amongst advocates of welfare is whether the broad approach to be taken should be a means-tested or a universal one. A means-tested approach attempts to explicitly target groups of people based on need, whether it be income, disability status, the unemployed, or a related signifier. A universal approach does not target groups and instead provides the same payments/goods/services to everyone in society. As previously shown, higher social spending is associated with lower poverty and inequality. However, there is some indication that countries can compensate for lower spending by more accurate targeting of low-income families<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/CE85800A38AC83F9EEAA1AD45880CC47</ref>. Targeted programs tend to be more efficient per dollar and have grown faster than universal programs, although are slightly worse in reaching those who are eligible. In the United States, they now play a prominent role in poverty reduction among those under age 65<ref>https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/20220806_ES_THP_SocialPrograms_ExpandedEdition.pdf</ref>.

A popular narrative argues that targeted programs are inherently weak politically and tend to be cut or eliminated over time and that universal programs inevitably do better. However, the history of recent decades in the US does not support the idea that targeted programs almost invariably do poorly politically and that universal programs virtually always outperform them. Mandatory programs that are targeted grew at a significantly faster annual average rate over the 1979-2019 period than the main universal mandatory programs. The story remains the same if the analysis begins in the 1960s rather than in 1979. Multiple factors beyond whether a program is targeted or universal affect its political strength or weakness. Universality does confer some advantages politically, but targeted programs have the advantage of having lower costs, which is often a prime consideration for policymakers<ref>https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/20220806_ES_THP_SocialPrograms_ExpandedEdition.pdf</ref>.

Welfare programs appear to be stronger and more politically durable when they<ref>https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/files/20220806_ES_THP_SocialPrograms_ExpandedEdition.pdf</ref>:
- Are tied to work or a work record, especially when beneficiaries have financed their benefits at least in part through payroll tax contributions;
- Serve working families who are significantly above the poverty line and often part of the middle class, along with those who are the poor as opposed to only the poor;
- Are fully federally financed;
- Are federally administered;
- Provide benefits either in kind or through the tax code rather than as straight cash, unless it’s for elderly or disabled;
- Are focused on groups like the elderly or children for whom there is more public support and who are not expected to be employed;
- Operate as entitlement programs rather than as discretionary programs that policymakers fund through the annual appropriations process; or
- Are considered by policymakers to be highly effective in achieving important goals.

It does appear to be the case that targeting works best when embedded in the overall framework of universalism, which implies that a balance is needed between selective and universal welfare regimes<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/CE85800A38AC83F9EEAA1AD45880CC47</ref>. Some services, such as healthcare, should probably be universal due to the benefits shown when those programs are universalized. However, other types of programs would be better if they were targeted according to income or other metrics, as already occurs with things such as progressive taxation for instance. There is no reason to expect that targeted or selective programs would be less politically sustainable in the long-run, and they are generally more efficient in terms of targeting those in need.

## Labor Economics

### Unions

### Minimum Wage

The minimum wage is one of the largest debates and most extensively studied subjects within economics. My view, based on the reading of research is that a minimum wage should not exceed 60 percent of the local median income in a developed country. However, there are many limitations to the minimum wage as a tool. Research suggests that the minimum wage is a worse anti-poverty tool compared to various types of welfare programs, and in some circumstances it can actually increase poverty when the disemployment effects are sufficiently large as well as adjustments on other margins such as prices. The minimum wage, when employed, cannot suffice as an efficient anti-poverty tool. The full effects of the minimum wage are discussed below.

#### Monopsony and Effects on Firms

There are three schools of thought when it comes to the minimum wage debate. All of these emphasize the importance of the responses that firms have to minimum wage increases as a determinant of the actual effects of minimum wages. The major two, the competitive and monopsonistic model, are in opposition as to whether a minimum wage can meaningfully improve the lives of workers.

The competitive model, which is commonly taught in basic economics courses, assumes as the name suggests that markets are perfectly competitive and always at an optimal equilibrium. A consequence of any minimum wage change will be higher unemployment and consequently an increased labor supply, due to firms being unable to afford a higher wage for their workers. This brings the market into disequilibrium and harms all parties involved<ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf</ref>. There is some evidence that the competitive model accurately describes the situation with the minimum wage. Firm exit is one piece of evidence which provides support for this model. If firms exist in a competitive market in which each firm has zero or near zero profit, we would expect to see that minimum wage increases would result in firms leaving, particularly lower-quality firms closer to the margin of exit. Data has shown this to be accurate<ref>https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/33111775/17-088.pdf;jsessionid=DFC2E1554F19FAD9B623717C22136BAC?sequence=1</ref>.

The second major model of the effects of a minimum wage on firm behavior is the monopsonistic or oligopsonistic model. Whereas a monopoly is a situation in which there is only one seller within a particular market, a monopsony is a situation in which there is only one buyer within a particular market. Firms are buyers within the labor market, and can thus theoretically operate as monopsonies. In the case of a monopsony, markets are not perfectly competitive, and firms have more market power. This means that they have an ability to set wages, and will deliberately avoid purchasing until the equilibrium level to hold down their own prices<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopsony.asp</ref>. Given that wages are deliberately set below the equilibrium level, those who subscribe to the monopsony model would assert that an effectively set minimum wage would enable the market price to equal the equilibrium price, ensuring that workers are paid more without increasing their levels of unemployment. Interestingly, the monopsony model actually predicts a small increase in employment as a consequence of an effectively set minimum wage, because it increases the supply of labor without preventing firms from purchasing that labor<ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf</ref>, assuming the price floor is not set too high. If it is, the monopsonist will reduce its purchases within the labor market and inefficiency occurs<ref>https://eh.net/encyclopedia/monopsony-in-american-labor-markets/</ref>. Given that a monopsony is generally nonexistent in the real world, the term "oligopsony" is often used in the empirical literature to refer to a set of a few firms which generally operate in the same way as a monopsony does.

There is a fair amount of evidence that monopsonistic/oligopsonistic models have some merit to them as well. Some firms, such as those in the tomato market have been observed exhibiting oligopsonistic characteristics<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3003381</ref>, amongst others<ref>https://eh.net/encyclopedia/monopsony-in-american-labor-markets/</ref>.

In terms of the effects of minimum wage on unemployment, there is a wide literature which all appears to disagree amongst itself about the effects of the minimum wage on unemployment. However, it generally suggests that there is a null or slightly negative effect of the minimum wage on employment. This is to some extent consistent with both competitive and monopsonistic models of the minimum wage, as the effects of minimum wages don't seem to go super hard either way. This could be due in part to the degrees to which different low-wage labor markets are competitive or monopsonistic. This is discussed in later sections.
It has been found that firm profitability decreases following increases in the minimum wage. Interestingly, this is neither evidence in favor of or against either the competitive or monopsonistic model of the minimum wage, as both would naturally predict a reduction in profitability from the minimum wage<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/25760249?seq=1</ref><ref>https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/203233/1/1667730924.pdf</ref>.

A third often not mentioned model of the minimum wage is the institutional/behavioral model. This model suggests that the situation with the minimum wage is a bit more complex than a competitive model would suggest, with cost absorptions occurring in a variety of areas as opposed to strictly employment. These can include reducing sales, improving service, economic expansion, and changes in internal wage structure. Moderate minimum wage increases are said to have no employment effect or a positive employment effect<ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf</ref>. There is also some evidence for this model, with channels of adjustment for minimum wages including some factors which are consistent with the institutional/behavioral model, including wage compression and higher performance standards. Because of this, a minimum wage's firm-related effects can be said to go beyond simply employment<ref>https://docs.iza.org/dp6132.pdf</ref>.

In sum, all three major models for how the minimum wage operates have some degree of merit to them, and we will examine the effects of the minimum wage as they apply to all of these models when looking at the channels of adjustment that firms engage in following minimum wage increases in more detail.

#### Channels of Adjustment

Firms can adjust to a minimum wage increase in a number of ways, most notably increasing employment. But beyond this, they can also change the labor market in other ways or increase prices to compensate. The research on this is discussed below.

**Employment**

Polling suggests that economists are split on whether the minimum wage causes adverse unemployment effects, or at least whether they make it harder for low-skilled workers to find employment<ref>https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/minimum-wage/</ref>. When looking at the actual empirical evidence on the subject, this starts to make more sense, as there is no consensus on the subject. Nonetheless, the overwhelming majority of the evidence according to meta-analytic research suggests there is no net effect of the minimum wage on employment or a small negative effect, even without taking into account publication bias which leans in favor of studies which find a negative effect of the minimum wage on employment<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1403498](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8543.2009.00723.x</ref><ref>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/601139/The_impact_of_the_NMW_on_employment_-_a_meta-analysis.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nelp.org/publication/raise-wages-kill-jobs-no-correlation-minimum-wage-increases-employment-levels/</ref>. All of this is done even while also increasing the wage of workers, as minimum wage laws intend to do. The broader economic effects of minimum wage workers will be discussed in more detail later on, but keep this in mind<ref>https://irle.berkeley.edu/seattles-minimum-wage-experience-2015-16/</ref>.

In terms of measurements of the precise elasticities of employment as a result of an increase in the minimum wage, the literature generally suggests that it is around -0.1, particularly with the more recent research on the subject. This means that a 1% increase in the minimum wage would be expected to decrease employment by 0.1%, a very small decrease<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/2724487?seq=38#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref><ref>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/844350/impacts_of_minimum_wages_review_of_the_international_evidence_Arindrajit_Dube_web.pdf</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/labr.12162</ref>. It is important to recognize, however, that these effects vary depending on which study you look at. For example, one study estimated an elasticity of around -0.7. Whether this is due to differences in methodology used, the nature of the markets that the minimum wage changes are situated in, or simply statistical noise, is difficult to say. Still, the evidence is overwhelmingly in support of an elasticity estimate of 0.1<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254583157_Are_the_Effects_of_Minimum_Wage_Increases_Always_Small_New_Evidence_from_a_Case_Study_of_New_York_State</ref>. Additionally, Clemens & Wither (2014) looked at the minimum wage in the context of the great recession, and found a significant negative effect of the minimum wage on employment and income growth<ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w20724</ref>. Given that recessions are often characterized by low profit margins, it would make sense that firms in labor markets would act in a manner more consistent with the competitive model and end up laying off more workers, reducing their income growth. I would naturally expect that the effects of a minimum wage would thus be worse in the context of a recession, so this result does not surprise me.

There is some literature which looks at the reasons for why this might be the case. One study for example found a substitution effect where highly productive teenagers have increased levels of employment and adults have decreased levels of employment as a result of minimum wages<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254429129_Minimum_Wage_Effects_on_Employment_Substitution_and_the_Teenage_Labor_Supply_Evidence_from_Personnel_Data</ref>. However, given a wealth of data which suggests that teen employment is either unaffected or slightly reduced as a consequence of minimum wages<ref>https://irle.berkeley.edu/files/2011/Do-Minimum-Wages-Really-Reduce-Teen-Employment.pdf</ref><ref>http://tankona.free.fr/nber28399.pdf</ref>, it is unlikely that this is a widespread case, if a case at all.

One study looked at how the minimum wage affects labor markets of different concentrations, and finds that there is variance in the employment effects of the minimum wage and how concentrated a particular labor market is<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26101/w26101.pdf</ref>. More concentrated labor markets which would act more monopsonistically have more positive employment effects, whereas less concentrated labor markets which would act more competitively have more negative employment effects. The new effect ends up balancing to zero. This is consistent with the idea that both competitive and monopsonistic models of the minimum wage have some level of merit to them. Moreover, if it is the case that the proportions of differently concentrated labor markets vary across time and geographical region, it could potentially explain the differing results that come up from the minimum wage literature.

Another important question to examine is the long-term effects of minimum wages on unemployment, which there is some data on. It appears that there may be slightly larger long-term effects of the minimum wage on unemployment<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/24736030#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0019793917692788</ref>, although these are also small.

While it is the case that the empirical evidence suggests little to no adverse effects of the minimum wage on employment, it is nonetheless undeniable that a sufficiently large minimum wage would have adverse employment effects. This is something which both proponents of the competitive and monopsony model can agree on. Because of this, it is useful to examine when a minimum wage goes too far in its adverse effects, Dube (2019) reviewed the literature and found that employment effects appear to be small up until around 59% of the median wage<ref>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/844350/impacts_of_minimum_wages_review_of_the_international_evidence_Arindrajit_Dube_web.pdf</ref>.

Historically, minimum wage laws have been advocated by some as a means to push black people out of the labor market through increasing the pressure of businesses to reduce their employment of low-skilled labor, which was and still is disproportionately black<ref>https://mises.org/wire/racist-history-minimum-wage-laws</ref>. Interestingly however, these policies appear to have had the opposite effect that was expected. While I have previously documented research on the effects of the minimum wage on broad inequality, there is also some on racial inequality specifically, which finds that minimum wages have reduced racial inequality where implemented<ref>https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/136/1/169/5905427</ref><ref>https://irle.berkeley.edu/racial-inequality-and-minimum-wages-in-frictional-labor-markets/</ref>. Therefore, it is more accurate to suggest that a minimum wage reduces racism rather than exacerbating it, although I would argue this shouldn't be framed in terms of racism as racial bias is not a substantive explanatory factor in accounting for racial disparities seen today (see [The Modern Narrative on Racism](https://prometheandissident.github.io/race/#the-modern-narrative-on-racism)).

An interesting question to examine is how the minimum wage would work in developing countries which are characterized by significantly higher levels of low-wage labor. In these contexts, the minimum wage also appears to be effective in reducing poverty<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/introducing-a-statutory-minimum-wage-in-middle-and-low-income-countries</ref><ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/does-increasing-the-minimum-wage-reduce-poverty-in-developing-countries/long</ref>. As for the threshold of a minimum wage, I'd imagine 59% of the median wage could work, although I am not super confident on this just due to how these types of labor markets likely operate significantly differently compared to those in developed countries where minimum wage effects are typically studied. Importantly, institutional mechanisms must be in place to actually enforce a minimum wage in order for it to be effective, which is a concern in developing countries where rule of law is more questionable in some contexts to say the least.

**Prices**

Another important concern is whether minimum wage increases are absorbed by price increases. The majority of the literature suggests that the price increases are fairly small in general<ref>https://docs.iza.org/dp1072.pdf</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6419.2007.00532.x</ref><ref>https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/study-raising-wages-to-15-an-hour-for-limited-service-restaurant-employees-would-raise-prices-4.3-percent.html</ref><ref>https://escholarship.org/uc/item/24t5h934</ref><ref>https://gspp.berkeley.edu/assets/uploads/research/pdf/The_Pass-Through_of_Minimum_Wages_into_US_Retail_Price.pdf</ref>. This suggests that minimum wages generally transfer money from firms or consumers to low-income consumers, meaning it is progressive. This appears to depend on the size of the hike, which is consistent with the monopsony model. Small minimum wage hikes do not lead to higher prices, while large minimum wage hikes do<ref>https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1278&context=up_workingpapers</ref>.

It should be acknowledged that the distributional effects of the minimum wage when taking this into account are progressive, but fairly small. This is because of the potential negative effects of the minimum wage on employment, the fact that minimum wages affect different income quintiles roughly the same (as the share of families with a minimum wage worker is roughly the same across income quintiles), and the natural price increases from a minimum wage. This translates into a moderate benefit for lower-income consumers but a substantial deadweight loss on the whole<ref>https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2017-01/BG3160_0.pdf</ref>. This isn't inherently a bad thing, as most taxes in general produce deadweight losses, but it is important to note as a drawback. The effect that a minimum wage hike will have on prices does appear to depend on policy design. Minimum wages indexed to a price measure appear to have a lower pass-through effect<ref>https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1278&context=up_workingpapers</ref>. I'd imagine that a minimum wage indexed on the median hourly wage would be similar in effect, and as discussed before, it appears that one pegged to 59% of the median hourly wage would have the greatest positive effect before getting into negative employment effects.

In short, price increases are important to consider but not sufficient to justify the notion that the minimum wage is inherently bad. While I did not find any data pertaining to how price levels would change as a minimum wage continues to increase, I would imagine it'd be roughly similar to the 59% of median wage number that a study found on employment. I suspect this because if employment effects don't become notable until 59% of the median wage, it is likely the case that some monopsonistic effects are operating until roughly that threshold, in which case not only is there less of a necessity to decrease employment at lower minimum wage levels, but there is less of a necessity to engage in other profit-maximizing measures, such as price hikes either. Due to this, I would consider this literature consistent with the idea that a minimum wage should be hiked to be roughly 59% of the median hourly wage.

**Labor Market Changes**

Consistent with the notion that neither the monopsony nor the competitive model can fully explain minimum wage effects, I found fairly contradictory evidence on how labor market flows are affected by the minimum wage, with some research suggesting increased labor market flows<ref>http://sarkoups.free.fr/dustmann719.pdf</ref> and some suggesting decreased labor market flows<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/685449</ref>. My suspicion is that the effects likely vary by industry and also by location as most minimum wage effects appear to vary. Ku (2020) suggests that the minimum wage increases labor productivity, which could arguably be due to either a monopsony or competitive model<ref>https://docs.iza.org/dp13369.pdf</ref>. I think in either case it makes sense why workers would want to improve their productivity, as they are potentially at risk of being squeezed out of the market, even in some cases with a monopsony model. Research on the levels of absenteeism is also consistent with the idea that workers are likely pressured to some extent as a consequence of minimum wage increases, as they often risk getting unemployed<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1588294</ref>. The minimum wage also has a variety of other effects on the labor market, which are also due to cost pressures<ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf</ref>:

- Increasing the likelihood and duration of unemployment for low-wage workers, particularly during economic downturns
- Encouraging employers to cut worker training
- Increasing job turnover
- Discouraging part-time work and reducing school attendance
- Driving workers into uncovered jobs, reducing wages in those sectors
- Encouraging employers to cut back on fringe benefits
- Encouraging employers to install labor-saving devices
- Increasing inflationary pressure
- Increasing teenage crime rates as a result of higher unemployment
- Encouraging workers to hire illegal aliens.
- Another channel of adjustment is labor-labor substitution within businesses, where some employers will replace their lowest-skilled workers with somewhat higher-skilled workers in response to increases in the minimum wage. Unions are strong supporters of minimum wages because of this reduction in competition.

Much of this research is consistent with the competitive model, although results from the monopsonistic model creep in as well. It does appear, however, that the competitive model is better at explaining how channels of adjustment operate following minimum wage hikes.

#### Effects on Quality of Life

Much of the research on the relationship between the minimum wage and poverty/workers wages appears to rest on the debate of how the minimum wage would affect employment. Given the conflicting research on that question, it is of no surprise that there is conflicting research on the issue of how the minimum wage affects poverty and wages<ref>https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/24285/1/dp4298.pdf</ref><ref>https://irle.berkeley.edu/files/2010/Minimum-Wage-Effects-Across-State-Borders.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/legacy/files/downloads_and_links/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf</ref>. However, if it is the case that the minimum wage has few unemployment effects until a certain threshold, which was established is likely around 59% of the median hourly wage, it stands to reason that poverty would likely decrease until roughly that point, at which it would start to reverse. The specific numbers of this may vary depending on a range of factors, but it makes sense that this would be the case.

Further complicating this issue however is the question of who benefits from the minimum wage, which does seem to be disproportionately the poor as suggested by data on minimum wages and prices<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4284/sej.2010.76.3.592</ref><ref>https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/PA701.pdf</ref>. However, as stated before the minimum wage is only moderately progressive. If my hypothesis is correct that the effects of the minimum wage is beneficial up until a certain threshold, it would help to explain the generally sympathetic views that economists have towards the minimum wage according to polling<ref>https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/minimum-wage/</ref>.

The minimum wage appears to decrease general income inequality, consistent with the idea that it increases the income of people while having little to no unemployment effects<ref>https://economics.mit.edu/files/11561](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20140073</ref><ref>https://ftp.iza.org/dp10572.pdf</ref>. However, once again, this appears to potentially reverse itself when it reaches a maximum effectiveness value. Litwin (2015) found a result of a maximum effectiveness value of $11.77 across OECD countries<ref>https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1388&context=student_scholarship</ref>, which appears roughly consistent with the 59% maximum before large unemployment effects occur. This doesn't mean that all poorer parties benefit. For example, poorer bosses appear to suffer more from the minimum wage<ref>https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/01/04/a-study-suggests-that-higher-minimum-wages-hit-poorer-bosses-pockets</ref>. This is consistent with research shown earlier about how the minimum wage pushes less successful businesses out of the market, given that they have lower profit margins. Still, overall the minimum wage reduces wealth inequality.

In general, the minimum wage has been found to have positive health effects, including reduced mortality<ref>https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303188</ref>, suicides<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25787/w25787.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/01/20/higher-minimum-wages-are-linked-to-lower-suicide-rates</ref>, and BMI<ref>https://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/w15485.pdf</ref>, as well as increased subjective well-being<ref>https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.baylor.edu/dist/2/1297/files/2010/09/Minimum_Wage_SWB_3.7.16_PF-293y1ob.pdf</ref> and life expectancy<ref>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27844176/</ref>. This is consistent with the idea that the minimum wage generally alleviates economic hardship for those who are most at risk of poor health conditions in society.

There is also research suggesting that minimum wage increases have a small but positive impact on education<ref>https://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/w16355.pdf</ref>. Given that the posited mechanism for this result is that unemployment increases as a consequence of the minimum wage which causes teenagers to become more educated to increase their job prospects, I'd imagine this is generally a null or small effect.

Research on crime suggests that the minimum wage can have positive or negative effects on crime, depending on whether the increase has notable effects on the unemployment rate relative to the wage increase<ref>https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160423_cea_incarceration_criminal_justice.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25116/w25116.pdf</ref><ref>https://epionline.org/app/uploads/2019/03/EPI_MinimumWageReducingCrimeStudy_Final-2.pdf</ref>. Due to this, it is likely the case that crime effects are roughly positive or null until the 59% threshold outlined earlier.

Finally, due to causing increases in spending, a minimum wage hike appears to increase economic growth<ref>https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-federal-minimum-wage-to-1010/</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w25761#:~:text=Using%20variation%20in%20minimum%20wages,and%20nominal%20spending%20rise%20modestly.</ref>. As with policies which increase aggregate spending in general, however, this is likely to be a short-term effect of a hike as opposed to a long-term consequence of having a minimum wage in place. In the long-term, it is likely the case that a minimum wage has roughly null effects on economic growth (see [On Fiscal Policy](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#on-fiscal-policy)).

### Unemployment Insurance

Unemployment insurance (UI) is a type of welfare program whereby the state creates an insurance program that pays a certain income to people on a weekly basis when they lose their jobs and meet certain eligibility requirements<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment-insurance.asp</ref>. Unemployment insurance functions as a type of "automatic stabilizer" during economic recessions, as recessions are associated with higher unemployment leading to higher fiscal spending during times of economic downturn - or an expansionary fiscal policy (see [On Fiscal Policy](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#on-fiscal-policy)). Similarly, during times of economic boom, spending on UI decreases, meaning that UI functions as a contractionary fiscal policy during booms.

One study found a fiscal multiplier effect of 1.92 for unemployment insurance benefit extensions, similar to estimates for other types of spending, pointing to strong demand-side effects<ref>https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2021/03/12/Supply-and-Demand-Effects-of-Unemployment-Insurance-Benefit-Extensions-Evidence-from-U-S-50112#:~:text=transfers,for%20other%20types%20of%20spending</ref>. Another study found a multiplier of 2.15<ref>https://www.nelp.org/app/uploads/2015/03/UI-Benefits-Workers-Employers-and-the-Struggling-Economy.pdf#:~:text=15,the%20recession%20of%20the%201980s</ref>. Another estimate puts it as 1.9<ref>https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/17-009_e68959ed-8e3d-4e06-95d1-3985f4e73ebb.pdf#:~:text=We%20assess%20the%20extent%20to,Consistent%20with%20a%20local</ref>. This means that for every dollar spent on unemployment insurance, economic output grows by approximately two dollars, meaning it can be an extremely effective form of expansaionary fiscal policy during recessions. Furthermore, unemployment benefits alone absorb 19% of unemployment shocks in Europe and 7% in the US<ref>https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/automatic-stabilisers-and-economic-crisis-europe-and-us#:~:text=1%29,considered%20to%20be%20drastically%20higher</ref>. This suggests that generous unemployment insurance in Europe in particular plays a key role in the stabilization of disposable incomes.

One concern that critics of UI often have is that it can create disincentives for individuals to find work, and they will use all of the benefits for the duration that the insurance payments are provided without finding a job until they actually need to. Under this notion, UI may provide immediate stimulus to an economy, but it can lead to work disincentives in the long run if utilized continuously. There is some evidence that UI expansions in terms of benefit amount as well as benefit duration. A Polish natural experiment found that increasing benefit levels or benefit durations by 10% both lead to a 3% increase in unemployment duration. As extending benefit durations has a larger impact on total benefits paid, this comes with a higher direct cost for taxpayers. Tracking workers over five years after their initial unemployment spell, they found no evidence that workers benefit from more stable job matches as there was no decreased unemployment probability over the five-year horizon. A 10% increase in potential benefit duration increases unemployment inflow by 1.2%, while a 10% icnrease in benefit level increases unemployment inflow by 13-16%<ref>https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/rethinking-unemployment-insurance-new-evidence-hidden-costs#:~:text=Leveraging%20the%20policy%20variations%20in,higher%20direct%20cost%20for%20taxpayers</ref>.

However, in the context of recessions, unemployment insurance has a positive effect on employment as it leads to greater labor demand than would have existed before. Furthermore, while there may not be any increased job stability derived from unemployment insurance, it does lead to higher re-employment wages which suggests that the quality of the jobs is higher for workers, and workers are engaging in more productive work for the economy. Thus, the net economic effects even in the absence of a recession are ambiguous.

Over the past 5 recessions as of 1999 in the USA, UI greatly reduced the negative impact. UI saved an average of 131,000 jobs in each downturn and quelled the drop in GDP by 15%. During the last recession (as of 2002), UI prevented tens of thousands of workers from falling into poverty. Without regular and extended UI benefits, over 70% of UI recipients would have fallen into poverty, compared to the 40% who experienced poverty after exhausting their regular UI benefits UI maintains worker’s earnings after unemployment, as it enables workers to find jobs that match their previous skills and earnings. Thus, it leads to a substantially higher re-employment wage<ref>https://www.nelp.org/app/uploads/2015/03/UI-Benefits-Workers-Employers-and-the-Struggling-Economy.pdf#:~:text=15,the%20recession%20of%20the%201980s</ref>. Furthermore, a study utilizing RDD in Austria found a positive UI wage effect through improving reemployment firm quality and attenuating wage drops<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150528#:~:text=UI%20raises%20wages%20by%20improving,quality%20and%20attenuating%20wage%20drops</ref>.

Because of all of these factors, I am sympathetic to having an unemployment insurance scheme. It is an effective automatic stabilizer which ensures that legislatures do not have to pass as much spending when recessions occur as they would otherwise have to pass. While it has tradeoffs, the higher job quality effects of UI schemes suggest that they may actually boost growth even outside of recessionary contexts, and are probably not as bad for growth as other welfare programs are. However, welfare programs in general have small negative growth effects at most, so this isn't a particularly large issue (see [The Welfare State](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#the-welfare-state)).

As for the optimal level of UI, a meta-analysis examining the link between unemployment insurance and unemployment found that the optimal replacement rate of UI is 28% in the US<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4929511#:~:text=We%20systematically%20review%20studies%20of,equal%20to%20the%20%E2%80%9Cmacro%E2%80%9D%20elasticity</ref>. This may be a good rough number to go off of as it ensures that unemployment effects aren't going to be substantially affected with an unemployment scheme. This doesn't answer the question of optimal benefit duration, however.

## Healthcare Policy

While in a lot of cases, targeted welfare programs tend to be less efficient relative to universal programs, the situation of healthcare provides a different story. Research from the Commonwealth Fund consistently shows that the United States healthcare system underperforms relative to the systems of other high-income countries. The main culprit with this is that the American system is the only high-income country to lack a universal healthcare system. This is despite the fact that as of 2023, the United States spends a whopping 16.5 percent of its GDP on healthcare - the largest of any country in the world<ref>https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2024/sep/mirror-mirror-2024</ref>.

A common argument in favor of the American healthcare system is that its comparatively laissez-faire approach means that it leads to high levels of drug innovation, which other countries free ride off of. Therefore, the United States is the reason why other healthcare systems do well as it provides all of the innovations through its lack of a universal system. However, this argument fails to recognize the crucial role that the private sector plays in pharmaceutical innovation due to providing basic research which does not have an immediate profit incentive (see [Maximizing Innovation and Technology](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#maximizing-innovation-and-technology)). In the United States, direct government funding is more important in the development of the most innovative new drugs than it is for standard drugs. Government funding has played an indirect role by funding basic underlying research that is built on in almost half of the drugs approved and in almost 2/3rds of priority-review drugs<ref>https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2009.0917</ref>. Furthermore, US pharmaceutical innovation is not exceptionally good compared to other countries as a proportion of its GDP and many countries with drug price regulation are significant contributors to pharmaceutical innovation<ref>https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2009.178491</ref>. The reality is that the American healthcare system is not a system which is exceptionally conducive to pharmaceutical innovation.

It should be noted that universality does not necessarily imply a public healthcare system. Many healthcare systems, including Switzerland, the Netherlands and Singapore have heavy private involvement in their system. However, universality does necessitate some level of government involvement in the system. In the Fraser Institute report entitled "Economic Principles for Prosperity", the authors note that the Canadian system, a universal healthcare system that primarily relies on public coverage of healthcare, spends a comparatively high proportion of its income on healthcare relative to other countries and yet performs worse than most European nations in terms of doctors per capita and other health outcomes. The reason why other countries perform better despite spending less is because they do not have a monopoly-insurer and monopoly-buyer system. Instead, they tend to have user fees, alternative, comprehensive, privately funded care, and private hospitals that compete for patient demand<ref>https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/economic-principles-for-prosperity.pdf</ref>.

In this respect, perhaps one of the most effectively managed healthcare systems in the world is Singapore. Singapore's healthcare system can be summarized in the 3 M's<ref>https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/countries/singapore#:~:text=Hospital%20Inpatient%20Care</ref>:

- Medishield Life is a mandatory universal basic healthcare insurance which provides lifelong protection against large hospital bills.
- Medisave is a national medical earnings scheme which helps cover out-of-pocket payments. Personal and employer salary contributions are mandatory for all working citizens and permanant residents. These tax-exempt, interest-bearing accounts can be used to pay for family members healthcare.
- MediFund is the government's safety net for needy Singaporeans who cannot cover their out-of-pocket expenses, even with medisave.

Singapore's healthcare system is characterized by copayments on healthcare services which individuals above a certain income threshold have to pay. Beyond a certain amount, however, healthcare is free. This ensures that individuals always have access to healthcare when they are in need, but prevents issues with overutilization which tend to exist in systems such as Canada, where long wait times are rampant. As research demonstrates, longer healthcare wait times are associated with greater risk of mortality<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1955366/</ref><ref>https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/effect-of-wait-times-on-mortality-in-canada.pdf</ref><ref>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2664460</ref>. Singapore's healthcare system is underpinned by the belief that all stakeholders have responsibility for attaining sustainable universal health coverage. The government relies on competition and market forces to improve service and raise efficiency but intervenes directly when the market fails to keep health care costs down. The government provides various subsidies to keep healthcare affordable in the country<ref>https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/countries/singapore#:~:text=Hospital%20Inpatient%20Care</ref>.

In per capita terms and as a percentage of GDP, Singapore's healthcare expenditures are the lowest of all the high-income countries in the world<ref>https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/affordableexcellence_chapter.pdf#:~:text=Singapore%20has%20achieved%20extraordinary%20results,income%20countries%20in%20the%20world</ref>. In 2016, total health expenditures represented 4.47 percent of Singapore’s GDP, with nearly 41 percent financed through public sources<ref>https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/2020-12/2020_IntlOverview_SING.pdf#:~:text=December%202020%20Singapore%20has%20achieved,not%20cover%20primary%20care%20or</ref>. An Ipsos 2023 survey found that 63% of Singapore residents rated their quality of healthcare as "good" or "very good", above countries like Canada, the United States, the UK, Sweden, and many others. The only countries it was below were Malaysia and Australia. However, 81% of Singaporeans said they were "fairly satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the government's healthcare policies, more than any other country surveyed<ref>https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2023-07/ipsos-global-perceptions-of-healthcare-2023.pdf#:~:text=satisfied%20with%20their%20government%E2%80%99s%20policies,most%20likely%20to%20be%20dissatisfied</ref>, suggesting that Singaporeans are more satisfied with their healthcare system than residents of any other country in the world are of theirs.

In terms of actual quality, researchers using a Healthcare Access and Quality Index found that Singapore ranked at 86.2 overall, which was lower than a number of high-income countries including Canada, Australia, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, but was higher than New Zealand, the UK, and the USA<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9666426/#cesec110</ref>. This suggests that while Singapore's healthcare isn't the best in the world, it is extremely effective in terms of getting a good bang for one's buck. With funding which matches many of the other countries which scored higher than them in terms of quality, Singapore's system would almost certainly match or exceed those systems. Furthermore, the fact that Singapore's system is one of the highest rated in the world according to their citizens, and has the highest levels of satisfaction of any system in the world in spite of its extremely low per-capita expenditures, shows that a Singapore or Singapore-like model would be extremely effective in terms of delivering universal, quality healthcare to individuals.

## Urban Policy

### General

Two major concerns of urban policy are urban sprawl and transit-oriented development. Urban sprawl should be countered through a mix of direct urban planning as well as deregulation which will ideally organically address the issue. Public transit provides significant economic value to a city and so it should be invested in.

Urban sprawl, which is a pattern of uncontrolled development among city peripheries, is increasingly common and negatively affects public health and the environment. For example, research suggests it contributes to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2936977/</ref>. Sprawl patterns, such as “loops and lollipops”, often require car access which puts a strain on affordability and limits the ability for lower-income people to easily access jobs and services<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169204618300744</ref>. Smart growth is a policy framework recommended to combat sprawl. It promotes high population density, walkable and bikeable neighborhoods, preserved green spaces, mixed-use development, available mass transit and limited road construction<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2936977/</ref>. Urban sprawl can also be addressed through reducing zoning regulations (see [Zoning](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#zoning-and-housing-regulations)).

Transit-oriented development (TOD) is an approach to transport and land use planning that aims to make walking, cycling and transit use convenient and desirable. Research suggests that TOD results in lower levels of car use, higher levels of public transport use, and much higher levels of walking. It is however difficult to implement because of organizational fragmentation between the various regional and local authorities, as well as private and public sector actors<ref>https://www.k2centrum.se/sites/default/files/fields/field_uppladdad_rapport/k2_research_2020_2_0.pdf</ref>.

High-quality public transport increases accessibility for people, which has a range of effects. It increases economic activity on both an aggregate and household level, it boosts employment although it increases housing prices. Public transportation improves social connections, especially for older people in isolated rural areas<ref>https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10203891/1/Alhassan%20and%20Anciaes%202025%20Public%20transport%20investments%20as%20generators%20of%20economic%20and%20social%20activity.pdf</ref>. Land value uplift from public transport varies in estimates across studies, but is generally found to be about 10 percent<ref>https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2024/02/the-future-of-public-transport-funding_d0cbc29f/82a4ba65-en.pdf</ref>.

### Housing

#### Trends in Housing Availability

In general, across developed countries there has been a consistent trend towards housing becoming less affordable. This is particularly interesting as it suggests that housing is the exception to the general rule of material progress which has characterized the development of wealthy countries. There appear to be two major factors involved in explaining why housing has become less affordable over time.

The first cause is changes in welfare regimes. While overall social spending has been increasing across OECD countries, the precise way in which welfare policies are implemented can still negatively affect the affordability or availability of  housing. Welfare regimes are important in determining housing outcomes, but many advanced economies have been experiencing welfare retrenchment and a move toward a market-driven housing system. The reduction of publicly subsidized housing removes some of the most affordable housing from the market, affecting the availability of housing for those in need<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02673037.2022.2123623</ref>. Over the past two decades, in OECD countries public investment in housing has declined substantially<ref>https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/affordable-housing.html</ref>.

A second reason concerns the actual development of housing. Not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) anti-development pressures have grown which lead to increasingly strict municipal policies and regulations<ref>https://docs.iza.org/pp203.pdf</ref>, making building new high-density housing very difficult (see [Zoning and Housing Restrictions](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#zoning-and-housing-restrictions)).

Therefore, as expected, the two major areas that countries and municipalities which want to increase availability and affordability of housing should focus on is their welfare programs and their regulation of housing. These will be discussed in turn.

#### Zoning and Housing Regulations

In most places, housing costs are close to the marginal physical costs of new construction, meaning that physical costs in most cases have little to do with relatively high prices. Rather, zoning has been found to be consistently associated with decreased affordability<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w8835/w8835.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/zoning-land-use-planning-housing-affordability</ref>. Housing regulations and zoning restrictions are significant in their effect on housing prices<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w10124/w10124.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nahb.org/blog/2021/05/regulatory-costs-add-a-whopping-93870-to-new-home-prices/</ref><ref>https://www.vtpi.org/park-hou.pdf</ref>. Zoning has been identified as the prime culprit behind surging house prices in England<ref>https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/regulation-blame-englands-surging-house-prices</ref>. Research in Australia found that as of 2016, zoning raised detached house prices 73 percent above marginal costs in Sydney, 69 percent in Melbourne, 42 percent in Brisbane and 54 percent in Perth<ref>https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2018/pdf/rdp2018-03.pdf</ref>. In Manhattan, despite home building being a highly competitive industry with almost no natural barriers to entry, prices appear to be more than twice their supply costs, suggesting land use regulations account for over half of the cost of the majority of housing units in the area<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w10124/w10124.pdf</ref>. More flexible land use rules in Tokyo explain their comparatively greater housing affordability<ref>https://www.southernurbanism.org/p/affordability-to-solve-for-housing</ref>. Zoning and land use restrictions contribute to urban sprawl<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377772662_A_global_analysis_of_land_use_regulation_urban_form_and_greenhouse_gas_emissions</ref>. Stringent restrictions on housing supply prevent workers from accessing high-wage regions leading to spatial misallocation of labor. Analysis of 220 metropolitan areas in the US found that these constraints lowered aggregate US growth by 36 percent from 1964 to 2009<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20170388</ref>.

Zoning regulations as well as housing regulations in general contribute to higher housing prices and lower economic growth, constituting a quintessential case where regulation not only reduces economic growth but also contributes to greater poverty (see [The Role of Regulation](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#the-role-of-regulation)). It is therefore crucial that they are minimized where possible and reasonable. Unfortunately, these regulations are politically difficult to remove in many cases. Homeowners tend to be disproportionately active in politics, and tend to support regulation as it increases the rents they get from their housing units through raising prices. In the absence of such regulation, homeowners can end up losing a significant amount of their net worth through price reductions when housing as an asset makes up a substantial proportion of that total. Furthermore, many homeowners place value on protecting the "character" of their neighborhoods beyond the direct effect it may have on housing prices. Due to these reasons, YIMBY-esque policies tend to be politically infeasible in many areas.

#### Rent Control

Rent control is often proposed as another solution to addressing issues of housing affordability. However, rent control does a poor job at targeting benefits to those who need them. Residents of rent-controlled units are less likely to move, meaning they often continue to live in houses that don't properly fit their needs. Rent control and rent stabilization policies also reduce the available supply of housing, which generally leads to higher rents in the uncontrolled market. There are also significant fiscal costs associated with implementing rent control and no consistent relationship between rent control and the prevalence of homelessness. There is also no substantial evidence supporting the idea that rent control decreases economic or racial segregation<ref>https://www.nmhc.org/globalassets/knowledge-library/rent-control-literature-review-final2.pdf</ref>.

Rent control therefore has essentially no upsides to it and should not be taken seriously as a policy option to address problems with a lack of housing.

#### Housing First and Other Anti-Homelessness Policies

The Finnish national program to reduce homelessness started in 2008 and renewed in 2012 built on housing first. This was a broad partnership between the national and municipal authorities and the non-profit sector, where Finland converted shelters into apartment units and constructed housing. Clients have a choice of programs, some of which ask for a commitment to sobriety, while others do not. Instead of receiving housing subsidies linked to the rent of the apartment, tenants pay for the entire rent using government-provided income sources, such as housing, child, disability, unemployment, student, and pension allowances, depending on the person's circumstances. If these don't suffice, social assistance fills the gap. To prevent conflict between tenants, tenants engage in "neighborhood work". This program led to homelessness largely ending<ref>https://0x0.la/u/w4UVmBP.pdf</ref>. While the Finnish housing interventions cost money, they save money in terms of the services needed by one person. Finland has a very low homeless population because they give people houses first as opposed to expecting people to sort their problems out before getting a home. Rents are paid for by the government, although the tenants can pay a portion depending on their income. Moreover, on top of this, to drive down housing costs, Finland has increased the supply of affordable rental housing to counter housing shortages<ref>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/how-finland-solved-homelessness/</ref>. Medicine Hat practiced housing first and became the first city in Canada to end chronic homelessness<ref>https://community.solutions/case-studies/medicine-hat-becomes-first-city-in-canada-to-end-chronic-homelessness/</ref>, although it lasted only 5 months. As of 2022, the number of people chronically rose to 19<ref>https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/homeless-medicine-hat-point-in-time-count-1.6600717</ref>.

Housing first policies can be divided into two broad categories: permanent supportive housing and rapid re-housing.

Permanent supportive housing is long-term housing in the community combined with support services tailored to the person’s needs, following the principles of “housing first” where housing is not contingent on abstinence from substance use. There is some evidence to suggest that it can increase housing stability, with a potential sustained benefit for up to 5.4 years. Some evidence suggests that it can also reduce visits to the emergency department and admission to the hospital. These benefits were seen in studies which included individuals who were mentally ill or had substance use disorders<ref>https://globalageing.cochrane.org/blog/13-housing-income-assistance-and-case-management-improve-housing-outcomes-persons-lived</ref>. Randomized trials comparing HUD-VA Supported Housing (HUD-VASA) to rent subsidies and intensive case management found that HUD-VASH veterans with psychiatric and/or substance use disorders had superior housing outcomes, with no significant differences on any measures of psychiatric or substance abuse status or community adjustment, although HUD-VASH clients had larger social networks<ref>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207801</ref>. HUD-VASH veterans had 25% more days housed than those in standard care, but it was $6200 (15%) more costly than standard care. Uptake of voluntary services that permanent supportive housing programs offer, such as case management, employment support and community based healthcare, increase when individuals have housing stability, and uptake of those increases housing stability itself<ref>https://community.solutions/what-is-housing-first/</ref>. Furthermore, the majority of housing first tenants do not return to homelessness, remaining stably housed at rates that often exceed those at traditional treatment first programs<ref>https://community.solutions/what-is-housing-first/</ref>. In Finland, beginning in 2007 national policies shifted toward reducing long-term homelessness through housing first programs. This shift in part led to the number of homeless individuals residing in hostels or boarding houses decreasing by 76 percent from 2008-2017<ref>https://housingfirsteurope.eu/country/finland/</ref>.

The second of the two types of “housing first” interventions is rapid re-housing. Rapid re-housing offers short-term assistance for individuals and families<ref>https://community.solutions/what-is-housing-first/</ref>. Comparing rapid re-housing, emergency shelters, and transitional housing, rapid re-housing was by far the least expensive intervention ($6,578 per stay compared to over $16,000 and $32,000 respectively), and was as if not more effective than the other crisis interventions<ref>https://endhomelessness.org/resources/research-and-analysis/findings-and-implications-of-the-family-options-study/</ref>. Long-term housing subsidies had a significantly positive impact on housing stability relative to usual care, reducing the proportion of families being homeless or doubled-up in the previous six months by 50% and reducing the proportion of families who experienced a shelter stay by 75%. Project-based transitional housing was less effective, and community-based rapid rehousing had no discernible impact on housing stability after 37 months. Regarding child well-being, long-term housing subsidies reduced behavior problems, the number of schools attended, and sleep problems. They reduced the proportion of families that were food insecure, but also slightly reduced labor force participation<ref>https://nlihc.org/resource/follow-family-options-study-long-term-housing-subsidies-are-most-effective-intervention</ref>.

Beyond housing first, there are several other measures often taken to try and alleviate homelessness. One is simply having housing subsidies or temporary financial assistance. Temporary financial assistance for individuals and families at imminent risk of homelessness averaging nearly $2000 significantly reduced homelessness by 3.8 percentage points from a base rate of 4.1 percent, largely driven by a reduction in emergency shelter use. Estimates suggest this is cost-saving, as the net public cost is $1822 per person, while the benefits to recipients are greater through income transfers, to landlords who do not have to turnover vacant units, and to members of the public from defusing violence. The effects of temporary financial assistance are larger for people with a history of homelessness and no children<ref>https://sites.nd.edu/james-sullivan/files/2023/04/SCC_homelessness_prevention-8-1.pdf</ref>.

Another policy is unconditional cash transfers, better known as a universal basic income. In an RCT that provided $7500 to individuals, cash recipients spent fewer days homeless, increased savings and spending with no increase in temptation goods spending, and generated societal net savings of $777 per recipient via reduced time in shelters<ref>https://hpri.usc.edu/homeless_research/unconditional-cash-transfers-reduce-homelessness/</ref>.

Finally of note is employment and skill-based programs. The Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is a model of supported employment that focuses on competitive employment in integrated work settings with supervision provided by personnel employed at the business. It is not exclusively focused on homeless people but a substantial proportion of those who undertake such programs have recently experienced homelessness. Those who are part of IPS programs have significantly better employment outcomes<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4417652/</ref>.

Housing first policies in general appear to save money, and I have no strong opinion on which programs may be preferable to the others. Permanent supportive housing and rapid re-housing are probably both good in differing circumstances and policy contexts. Temporary financial assistance may also be valuable in cases where a city cannot directly find a house for an individual to live within. In the long run, employment and skill-based programs could be a positive step towards reducing dependency on anti-homelessness programs, and so these should also be pursued in any broad anti-homelessness strategy. Finally, while unconditional cash transfers appear to reduce homelessness, they fall into the problems of universal welfare programs being inefficient, and should instead be replaced with targeted programs if done, in which case they would be very similar if not identical to temporary financial assistance programs in their implementation (see [The Welfare State: The University Question](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#the-universality-question)).

#### Public Housing and Subsidized Housing

The United States’s housing choice voucher program is the country’s largest rental assistance program and helps more than 2 million low-income families rent modest units of their choice in the private market. It has been shown to be very effective in reducing homelessness, housing instability, and overcrowding and at improving other outcomes for families and children. In the United States, they lift more than a million people out of poverty. There is mixed evidence on how rental assistance affects employment and earnings<ref>https://www.cbpp.org/research/research-shows-housing-vouchers-reduce-hardship-and-provide-platform-for-long-term-gains</ref>. Another system, Vienna’s social housing system, uses rent cross subsidization, whereby the rents of tenants with higher incomes offset the lower rents paid by people who earn less. In the city, 60 percent of the population live in social housing, and the program is widely popular among its residents. This public option competes with the private market to drive down housing costs of private units<ref>https://www.socialhousingcenter.org/reports-3</ref>.

It appears that both direct public provision of housing as well as housing subsidies can be effective means of increasing housing affordability and availability, and they also have a strong potential to be politically popular in places where it is implemented. This could be an effective means to alleviate housing problems which doesn't fall into the political unviability of regulation-based housing reforms (see [Zoning and Housing Regulations](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#zoning-and-housing-regulations)). Both of them constitute ways of addressing housing problems in cases where the free market might not be able to address it on its own.

## The Open Economy

### Labor Exploitation

One of the largest critiques made of how globalized market economies function today is that they allegedly engage in high levels of labor exploitation against workers from underdeveloped countries. These concerns generally surround one of two alleged injustices. The first is the usage of child labor in many underdeveloped countries, and the second is the concern about the working conditions within many of these jobs. Many take these two things as reasons for why there should be stronger labor regulations in underdeveloped countries. These two concerns will be discussed in turns, starting with child labor.

It should be noted that historically, bans on child labor have not been the primary reason for declines in child labor, but rather improvements in industrialization and economic growth which brought rising incomes which allowed parents to keep their children out of the workforce<ref>https://sci-hub.st/10.3368/jhr.XL.1.77</ref><ref>https://eh.net/encyclopedia/child-labor-in-the-united-states/</ref>. Research in fact suggests that in the case of India's Child Labor Ban, the relative probability of child employment increased and child wages relative to adult wages decreased after the ban, as well as decreased young child participation in schooling<ref>https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/jeea/jvz059</ref>. This is consistent with the idea that families use child labor to satisfy basic subsistence needs, which don't go away simply due to a ban on child labor. Similar results have been found in Bangladesh following the 1993 United States Child Labor Deterrence Act<ref>https://www.cato.org/economic-development-bulletin/case-against-child-labor-prohibitions</ref>.

The fact is that while child labor is often consideed an injustice, in certain contexts it is better than the alternative. If a family cannot feed itself in the absence of having their children go work in a manufacturing job, child labor bans risk cutting off that source of income. Empirical evidence suggests that child labor bans are not effective in terms of bettering the outcomes of the very children that they are meant to protect. Hence, restrictions on child labor cannot be reasonably be expected to occur in developing countries, and should be reserved only in situations where a country has economically advanced sufficiently.

The second concern that pops up is the quality of the working conditions that many underdeveloped countries have, particularly when multinational corporations begin employing their citizens. While sweatshops are commonly said to be unjust due to their poor labor conditions, when examining the evidence one should compare how the presence of sweatshops in already impoverished countries affects the workers who work in them as well as the broader domestic economy. Research suggests that multinational firms, the firms which have sweatshop jobs, pay more than domestic firms in third world countries and that sweatshop jobs provide workers with above average living standards<ref>http://hseuenglish102.pbworks.com/f/JobsworththeSweat.pdf</ref>. Foreign ownership of firms raises wages by expanding labor production and the scale of production, improving the conditions of work in the process. Not only that, but foreign-owned firms in fact make use of labor organizations and democratic institutions<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c9541/c9541.pdf#page=45</ref>. While child labor occurs, the vast majority of child laborers of sweatshops and carpet factories are members of landless, very poor families, making it an economic necessity, especially in single mother families where it may be the only source of income. These are situations where children lack access to education regardless of whether they work in sweatshops or not due to them needing to work to sustain their families, regardless of the type of work<ref>https://www.cips-cepi.ca/2018/02/26/the-ethics-of-buying-clothes-produced-in-sweatshops/</ref>. All of this helps to explain why workers subjectively perceive factor employment to provide more stable compensation<ref>https://0x0.la/u/F6CEuq4.pdf</ref>.

The closure of sweatshops cuts off a major source of income for the poor in the short-run, and decreases GDP in the medium term, which helps to explain why sweatshops have been a necessary existence at some point in the development of all nations since the beginning of the industrial revolution<ref>https://www.cips-cepi.ca/2018/02/26/the-ethics-of-buying-clothes-produced-in-sweatshops/</ref>. It should be noted furthermore that foreign firms that tend to be the employers of sweatshop labor often provide better living conditions than would exist in the absence. For example, in India’s manufacturing sector, foreign firms pay higher wages and salaries than domestic firms<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23210222211051453</ref>. In general, concerns about labor exploitation ignore the economic contexts that developing countries persist in. In ignoring that context, policies that spring forth can risk harming the very people they are intended to help.

### Tariffs and Free Trade

Tariffs are a type of trade barrier where importers have taxes or duties levied on them<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/tariff-trade-barrier-basics.asp</ref>. They can be ad valorem, where they are levied as a fixed percentage of the value of the import, or they can be a fixed amount on a specific good, or a “specific tariff”. There are also “tariff rate quotas” which are tariffs that rise significantly after a certain amount of imports is reached<ref>https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-are-tariffs#chapter-title-0-8</ref>. Other trade barriers can include quotas, licenses, and standardization, all seeking to make foreign goods more expensive or available in a limited supply<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/tariff-trade-barrier-basics.asp</ref>. Governments may raise tariffs to raise revenue or protect domestic industries from foreign competition<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-are-tariffs-and-how-do-they-affect-you/</ref>. By distorting resource allocations, tariffs are generally thought to reduce economic welfare<ref>https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/trump-tariff-policy-uncertainty-and-role-economics</ref>. Tariffs are generally passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices of imports. This generally has a regressive effect as the poor are the most harmed by the increase in prices<ref>https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-are-tariffs#chapter-title-0-8</ref>. Cross-country research shows that tariffs lead to declines in domestic output and productivity, more unemployment, higher inequality, and real exchange rate appreciation. However, the effect on output is concentrated among input tariff increases, and there is no effect of output tariff increases on output<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25402/w25402.pdf</ref>. While domestic industries can benefit from the reduced competition that tariffs bring, in the long term businesses can see a decline in efficiency as a result<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/tariff-trade-barrier-basics.asp</ref>. Over the 1950-98 period, countries that liberalized their trade regimes experienced average annual growth rates that were about 1.5 percentage points higher than before liberalization<ref>https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/660841468162283031/pdf/775730JRN020080alization0and0Growth.pdf</ref>.

Because of the negative effects often associated with trade barriers such as tariffs and import quotas, they should be as limited as possible. But tariffs should be viewed as vastly preferable to import quotas. While it is the case that there for any given tariffs, a quota policy could be implemented instead to achieve the identical economic outcome in terms of price and quantity of the import, import quotas are more vulnerable to rent-seeking behavior (see [Corrupting Influence of Capitalism](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#corrupting-influence-of-capitalism?)), which can cement market power in an economy. Thus, when trade barriers are implemented, tariffs should be employed over import quotas.

Free trade and globalization are overall positive for society. While there is publication bias in the literature, even correcting for publication bias economic globalization has a positive effect on economic growth, although this is primarily driven by trade globalization. Financial globalization may have zero effect<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/twec.13235</ref>. International trade regulation can create jobs in the sectors it protects or promotes, but almost always at the expense of destroying a roughly equivalent number of jobs elsewhere in the economy<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/international-trade-regulation-and-job-creation</ref>. While globalization can increase inequality, the larger economic pie it generates can be used to fund social programs which can alleviate the hardship associated with rapid economic transitions which often coincide with globalization, without sacrificing the positive growth generated by globalization (see [The Welfare State](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#the-welfare-state)).

### Exchange Rates

Neither a fixed exchange rate regime nor a floating exchange rate regime has operated perfectly in all cases where they have been implemented. The primary political difference between a fixed and floating exchange rate regime is whether or not a country can engage in monetary policy. Monetary policy affects interest rates which therefore leads to exchange rates being manipulated, meaning that monetary policy is only possible under a floating exchange rate regime. When countries are able to adopt a prudent monetary policy without having a fixed exchange rate, a floating exchange rate is generally preferable. This is likely to happen when there is central bank independence and there is a clear guideline for the central bank’s objective. In countries where there are high levels of corruption or other government failures, a fixed exchange rate is preferable <ref>https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_international-economics-theory-and-policy/s27-05-which-is-better-fixed-or-float.html</ref>.

There are a number of costs associated with fixed exchange rate regimes. Research shows that fixed exchange rate regimes are associated with greater susceptibility to currency and financial crises, such as debt crises, a sudden stop in capital inflows, or banking crises. Furthermore, these regimes through ending monetary policy as a tool impede timely external adjustment to macroeconomic conditions. More rigid regimes are associated with much stronger effects of fiscal policy on output, often leading to more instability in the overall international monetary system when deficits and surpluses have stronger impacts<ref>https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2009/12/pdf/ghosh.pdf</ref>.

I am in favor of high-income countries having floating exchange rate regimes as they are more likely to be able to satisfy the requirements of central bank independence and a clear central bank mandate. The presence of a floating exchange rate allows a country to engage in monetary policy, which can prove extremely valuable in stabilizing economic output (see [On Monetary Policy](https://prometheandissident.github.io/economics/#on-monetary-policy)).

### Immigration

Immigration often comes with a tradeoff between positive economic effects and (to some degree) negative social effects, especially when accounting for research on ethnic diversity in cases where immigration is non-white.

<span style="background-color:orange">Write overview that's more detailed once finished compiling all of the information into this section</span>

#### Economic Effects

There are two broad parts to the debate on immigration. The first part is the economic effect of immigration, and this is the area where unambiguously immigration in general has a positive effect. Immigration is positively associated with economic growth per person<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176505002594</ref>, with the majority of research suggesting that immigration causes higher economic growth per person<ref>https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/DOES-IMMIGRATION-HAVE-AN-IMPACT-ON-ECONOMIC-AND-Feridun/d28ac1f06ddca71a6b4d22a33467ab40e23e22de</ref><ref>https://doi.org/10.1111/labr.12017</ref>. This is because immigration increases labor supply, human capital accumulation, savings rate, total factor productivity, and technological progress<ref>https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-77796-0_9</ref><ref>https://doi.org/10.3386/W15507</ref><ref>https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC109196</ref>. Immigration also tends to increase the business failure rate, which leads to higher levels of entrepreneurship and a more dynamic economy<ref>https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JEPP-01-2015-0002/full/html</ref>. Immigrants to the US are more entrepreneurial than the native population and are overrepresented among high-growth startups and venture-backed tech firms<ref>https://www.nber.org/be/20242/immigrant-entrepreneurship-us</ref>. Immigration, especially among high-skilled entrepreneurial immigrants, increases innovation, firm startups, patent counts, and general economic dynamism<ref>https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2021/effects-immigration-entrepreneurship-innovation</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y</ref>.

With that being said, just because immigration in general has had positive effects in terms of economic growth, doesn't mean that every immigrant that comes into a country will be economically beneficial. For example, while immigration shocks tend to have positive effects on domestic output and productivity in the short and medium turn, some research suggests that refugee flows do not have the same effect<ref>https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/12/14/The-Macroeconomic-Effects-of-Large-Immigration-Waves-542526</ref>. Refugees have a lower employment rate and income level than family reunion migrants and labor migrants, but over time this income and employment gap diminishes or disappears altogether. One reason for the slower adaptation is because of the depreciation of human capital and credentials due to asylum and skill accreditation processes<ref>https://wol.iza.org/uploads/articles/269/pdfs/integrating-refugees-into-labor-markets.pdf</ref>. This suggests that refugees, while still poentially positively benefitting the economy, may not always do so.

Governments can implement policies to help capitalize on the beneficial impacts of immigration. Generally speaking, this can take the form of integration policies, which research suggests can help ease the transfer of foreign human capita<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/skill-based-immigration-economic-integration-and-economic-performance</ref>. Improved language training for refugees has a significant, permanent and positive effect on their earnings<ref>https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/106/4/1157/111513/Language-Training-and-Refugees-Integration?redirectedFrom=fulltext</ref>, as well as increasing their integration<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537123000416</ref>. These policies can increase the effects that immigration has on economic growth.

There are a number of economic concerns that are brought up with regards to immigration. The most significant one is whether immigration has a detrimental effect on the labor market outcomes of native workers. The overall evidence suggests that immigrants have a small negative aggregate effect on native employment and wages in the short run<ref>https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/a-meta-analytic-assessment-of-the-effect-of-immigration-on-wages-3</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y</ref><ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-migrants-take-the-jobs-of-native-workers</ref><ref>https://lem.univ-lille.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/laboratoires/lem/doc_de_travail_2021/DT2021-04.pdf</ref>, and a positive effect on both in the long run following labor market adjustment<ref>https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1111/joes.12300</ref>. This short-term negative effect is not distributed evenly across the entire economy but is concentrated in the industries where the immigrants are concentrated in<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00380237.2013.766834</ref>, which is commonly but not always in low-skill industries<ref>https://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/articles/1998/wagestudy/wages.pdf</ref><ref>https://economics.nd.edu/assets/263109/jmp_turner.pdf</ref>. Some evidence suggests that immigration may also improve the health of native workers<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrants-improve-health-of-native-workers</ref>. Taken together, this research suggests that while immigration representing a labor supply shock leads to lower wages and higher unemployment in the short-run, it can actually lead to higher wages and more employment of natives in the long run once the labor market adjusts to the supply shock.

A second large concern is the effect of immigration on the budget of a state. If immigrants take up a large proportion of a state's budget from expenditures such as welfare payments, that can be a reason against having immigration. Most research suggests that the net fiscal impact of immigration is highly varied but generally zero<ref>https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/IMO-2013-chap3-fiscal-impact-of-immigration.pdf</ref><ref>http://cdn-odi-production.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/documents/fiscal_space_paper_final.pdf</ref>. However, this is dependent on the policy environment, including the extent to which labor markets absorb migrants, the informality of labor markets and migrants' rights to work and receive welfare benefits. It is also dependent on the age of immigrants and their migration category. In OECD countries, immigrants are generally not taking up more benefits than the native-born, and contribute more in taxes and contributions than governments spend on their social protection, health and education. The average net fiscal contribution is about 0.9% of GDP<ref>https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/economic-impact-of-migration.html</ref>.

Labor/highly educated migrants tend to have a higher fiscal position than humanitarian migrants due to their more favorable labor market outcomes<ref>https://doi.org/10.1086/654705</ref><ref>https://www.oecd.org/els/mig/IMO-2013-chap3-fiscal-impact-of-immigration.pdf</ref><ref>http://cdn-odi-production.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/documents/fiscal_space_paper_final.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/institute/working-papers/17-13.pdf</ref>. Refugee or non-western immigration has been almost unanimously shown to have a negative effect on the fiscal balance<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12181</ref><ref>https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1111/imig.12520</ref>. With proper integration of refugees however, it is possible that the fiscal gains in the long-term due to refugees contributing to the economy may significantly outweigh the short-term costs<ref>https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/sites/futurium/files/jrc107441_wp_kancs_and_lecca_2017_4.pdf</ref>.

A third concern is how immigration affects housing prices or general inflation. In general, immigration tends to reduce prices with the exception of housing prices<ref>https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y</ref><ref>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/741926/Final_EEA_report.PDF</ref>. Data from meta-analyses suggest that immigration on the aggregate increases home prices<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718302481#:~:text=Using%20an%20instrumental%20variables%20strategy,locating%20in%20the%20same%20provinces.</ref>. For example, Cochrane & Poot (2021) finds that a 1% increase in immigration in a city increases rents by 0.5-1%, with the effect on housing prices being about double of that<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347406420_Effects_of_Immigration_on_Local_Housing_Markets</ref>. Nonetheless, the effect can vary in part due to the degree to which natives respond by moving from areas that migrants settle in. However, because in the long-run wages of natives rise on average due to immigration, the average rent burden does not change<ref>https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s10109-010-0111-y</ref>.

Finally, concerns that immigration tends to increase wealth inequality among natives, increasing the profits of a few while impoverishing the many, is simply false. Beyond the evidence against this in the previous research, research directly examining this suggests that immigration tends to increase population-level socioeconomic inequality, although it does not increase native wage inequality<ref>https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/immigration-and-inequality.pdf</ref><ref>https://openpsych.net/files/papers/Kirkegaard_2015a.pdf</ref>.

Overall, immigration is beneficial for the economy. Immigration helps slow aging in the US and grows the labor force. The children of immigrants are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors to the US population overall. While on average, first-gen immigrants are more costly to governments than the native-born mainly because they earn less and pay less in taxes, by the second generation they are better-educated, pay more in taxes and are strong economic and fiscal contributors. Immigrants have also contributed to price reductions in childcare, food preparation, house cleaning and repair and construction<ref>https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/press-release/nas-report-finds-immigration-win-us-economy/</ref>.

#### Social Effects

A number of social effects of immigration have also been studied. Many of the alleged negative effects of immigration have been shown to be exaggerated generally speaking. However, that doesn't mean that there aren't any social effects that we need to account for. Perhaps the largest one is a concern about social cohesion. Many argue that immigration is negative because it undermines social and cultural commonalities which bind people together within communities, ultimately leading to a more atomized society. While this argument can in theory be employed against having any level of immigration into a country, this is particularly used to argue against immigration which doesn't fit the ethnic or cultural background of the host country. It should be noted that the actual effect of ethnic diversity on social cohesion, while negative, is in practical terms very small(see [Research on the Effects of Ethnic Diversity: Social Effects](https://prometheandissident.github.io/race/#social-effects:-mixed)). Furthermore, direct research on this subject suggests that a sudden and significant influx of refugees has no statistically significant effect on social trust, general perceptions of society, or concerns about crime. The only significant effect is on donations to charity, which reduce with more refugees<ref>https://newsroom.iza.org/en/archive/research/does-immigration-undermine-social-cohesion-in-the-receiving-country/</ref>. Even in cases where the culture and ethnicity of the immigrants is likely to be significantly different from that of natives, there is little reason to suggest it will significantly negatively affect social trust.

Other social effects of immigration are non-existent or positive. An example of this is the aggregate link between immigration and crime. The overall research suggests that there is a negative immigration-crime association, but one which is very weak and has significant variation across studies<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235261537_Immigration_reduces_crime_An_emerging_scholarly_consensus</ref><ref>https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092026</ref>. This is unlikely to be due to reporting bias, as there is a high degree of correspondence between self-reports of arrest and official reports of arrest amongst immigrants, suggesting their lower levels of offending are not due to under-reporting<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-016-9314-9</ref>.

This of course varies depending on what type of immigrants are being discussed. Correlates of immigrant crime include national IQs and Islam prevalence in the home countries<ref>https://openpsych.net/paper/14/</ref><ref>https://openpsych.net/paper/13/</ref><ref>https://openpsych.net/paper/50/</ref>, whether the immigrants are disproportionately young and male<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/zehcls.pdf</ref>, and the degree to which the increase in immigrant population increases ethnic diversity/heterogeneity<ref>https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19950-4_14</ref><ref>https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:684766</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022427817696955</ref>. On the other hand, unauthorized immigrants are less likely to commit misdemeanor and felony crimes than the US-born population and other immigrant groups<ref>https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/immigrants-and-crime</ref><ref>https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2014704117</ref>, and undocumented immigration has a negative link to violent crime<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6241529/</ref>.

The effects of an expanded welfare state, usually measured in the form of social spending, have been studied extensively:

- **Mental Health -** While there is a stigma surrounding welfare uptake<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/30011810</ref><ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14265381_Welfare_Participation_and_Self-Esteem_in_Later_Life</ref>, evidence suggests that the mental health of people who are in need increases when they are given welfare<ref>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/185890</ref><ref>https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/THE-SHORT-TERM-IMPACT-OF-UNCONDITIONAL-CASH-TO-THE-Haushofer-Shapiro/261e2442f2b293c05e40d6b9d481ab32d2bcc250?p2df</ref>.
- **Consumption of Drugs/Temptation Goods -** World Bank (2014) reviewed the literature on the effect of cash transfers on the consumption of temptation goods and found that cash transfers had no effect on the consumption of temptation goods or ended up reducing it<ref>https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/617631468001808739/pdf/WPS6886.pdf</ref>.


**EITC > Minimum Wage** The minimum wage is worse at affecting poverty compared to an earned income tax credit, because it does not target households in need as well and the EITC increases labor force participation and employment<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/minimum-wage-versus-earned-income-tax-credit-for-reducing-poverty</ref>.

Across OECD countries, public social spending is about 20% of GDP as of 2019, remaining about the same since 2010. Public spending significantly increased between 1960 and 1990 across countries, and then increased substantially between 1990 and 2010, albeit at a slower rate. This is because budgtary constraints led many countries to tighten eligibility criteria to access social support and/or curtail the real growth of payment rates and/or privatize social spending by increasing the responsibility of workers for supporting sick and disabled workers<ref>https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2020/11/social-spending-makes-up-20-of-oecd-gdp_4afe7b22/89e34d81-en.pdf</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Monetary/Fiscal Policy</span>

Quantitative easing tends to ease financial conditions and support economic growth, and can be especially powerful during times of financial stress<ref>https://www.piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/quantitative-easing-underappreciated-success</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:yellow">Immigration</span>

Border walls are effective in keeping illegal immigrants out<ref>https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1655779599958114310</ref>.


Legal immigrants tend to be fiscally positive, while illegal immigrants in the US tend to be fiscally negative. Mass deportations would significantly reduce the national debt over the long run, but a policy of selective legalization coupled with mass deportations would be even more fiscally beneficial, reducing the debt by about $1.9 trillion. Doubling the number of H-1B visas for a single year given the education, age and earnings of recipients would reduce the budget deficit by $70 billion over the long run, and by another $70 billion each year thereafter. The most beneficial immigration policy change would be to excempt STEM graduate degree holders from green-card caps, increasing immigration by 15,000 per year and reducing the visa backlog. This would reduce the deficit by $150 billion in the first year and $25 billion each year thereafter. Eliminating refugee resettlement and permanent immigration by parents of U.S. citizens would reduce the debt by a combined $40 billion in net present value every year. Congress could upskill the existing immigration flow by eliminating the diversity visa category and increasing the visas available to the top employment-based categories, and requiring immigrants to have earned a high school diploma to be eligible for a family visa, reducing the national debt by over $60 billion per year<ref>https://manhattan.institute/article/the-lifetime-fiscal-impact-of-immigrants</ref>.

A selective immigration policy, which requires securing the border from unlawful immigration, reducing low-skilled immigration and expanding high-skilled immigration, the US could reduce the future federal debt by trillions. This slightly decreases annual legal immigration over the long term<ref>https://manhattan.institute/article/the-lifetime-fiscal-impact-of-immigrants</ref>.

Refugees and asylees had a positive fiscal impact at the federal, state and local levels in the US from 2005-2019<ref>https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/28fe4e756499bdab08b4e6cb3b952e22/aspe-report-refugee-fiscal-impact.pdf</ref>.

Assimilation (at least perfect assimilation) is not possible with many ethnic groups. For example, there are large black-white disparities which have persisted in domains including economics, education and crime and have not converged in many cases for many decades, despite African Americans living in the US for centuries<ref>https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/the-assimilation-myth-america?utm_source=multiple-personal-recommendations-email&utm_medium=email&triedRedirect=true</ref>.

Immigrants who succeed versus those who don’t succeed generally do so because of pre-arrival characteristics. For example, immigrant earnings are strongly associated with per capita GNP in the source country. Variation in educational attainment across immigrant groups is strongly associated with human capital possessed by their ancestors<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002716214548396</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/papers/w29418</ref>.

Research looking at immigrant grandfathers in 1880 and grandsons in 1940 shows that European ethnic disparities in occupational income were very persistent<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20170382</ref>.

Technology and productivity tend to be highly persistent even at very long time horizons. Neolithic and/or historical advantages continue to have effects on contemporary income per capita, consistent with Diamond’s hypothesis. Countries using the most advanced technologies in the year 1000 BC tend to remain the users of the most advanced technologies in 1500 and today. This long-term persistence holds at the level of populations rather than locations. Long-term genealogical links across populations play an important role in explaining the transmission of technological and institutional knowledge and the diffusion of economic development. Nonetheless, there is still room for development policies to reduce barrier effects and to accelerate the spread of ideas and innovations across populations, especially in the contexts of a globalized world which allows these to be diffused more rapidly than ever<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.51.2.325</ref>.

Sanctuary policies reduce deporations without increasing crime<ref>https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2014673117</ref>. These reduce deportations of people with no criminal convictions by half without affecting the deportations of people with violent convictions.

Legalizing unauthorized immigrants allows them greater labor market and geographic mobility, access to health and social services and equal protection under the law. It can also bring undocumented immigrants out of the informal sector and into the formal one, increasing tax revenues<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/legalizing-undocumented-immigrants</ref>.

### <span style="background-color:yellow">Economic/Social Effects</span>

**Economic Effects: Generally Positive**

- **Brain Drain: Negative for Home Country -** Brain drain, the phenomenon of educated people leaving poorer countries to go to richer countries where they will find better economic opportunities. In poor countries, brain drain can change the skill structure of the labor force, cause labor shortages, and affect fiscal policy, but can also generate remittances and other benefits from expatriates and returnees. In spite of remittances, evidence suggests there are many more losers than winners among developing countries. Whether a country gains or loses depends on country-specific factors, such as level and composition of migration, the country's level of development, population size, language, and geographic location. Brain drain appears to decrease with economic development<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/brain-drain-from-developing-countries</ref>.

*Note: Remittances may help to deal with negative brain drain issues.

**Social Effects: Mixed**

- **Political: Pro-Left -** Immigration to the US is negatively associated with republican vote share<ref>https://files.catbox.moe/6zjldh.pdf</ref> and immigration status positively predicts democratic affiliation<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ssqu.12621</ref>. However, while this is a net effect favoring more left-wing ideologies, natives tend to respond to immigration through support for extreme right political parties and a more protectionist response to immigration<ref>https://www.sv.uio.no/esop/english/research/news-and-events/events/conferences-and-seminars/2015/Docs/skillcell.pdf</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/imig.12409</ref>.
- **Educational: Slightly Negative -** Higher concentration has a negative or null effect on the educational outcomes of native children<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/immigrants-in-classroom-and-effects-on-native-children</ref>. The negative effects tend to be small, vary by country, and seem to be related to disadvantaged immigrants or refugees. This may be remedied by improving support and immigrant children's language acquisition. Immigration tends to lead to a schooling choice flight amongst students<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775716301789</ref>. This tends to increase school segregation, with wealthier locals being more likely to opt out of private schooling into private schools<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-007-9035-8</ref><ref>https://docs.iza.org/dp3946.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002205311300121X</ref>. Immigration also leads to a decrease in public education expenditures<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272711000788</ref>, with Speciale (2012) estimating that the elasticity of education spending with respect to immigrant population share is -0.15<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272712000382</ref>.

**Note on effects of immigration enforcement: It works, but undoes the positive economic effects of immigration.** Regulations on immigration in general have a significant effect on immigration flows, suggesting that states are able to control their borders<ref>https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6765.12279</ref>. Enforcement of immigration, whether it be on the border or interior of a country, reduces the probability that an individual will decide to illegally migrate<ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/enforcement-and-illegal-migration</ref>. However, immigration enforcement is costly to the government, decreases the labor force, reduces real GDP, and has no meaningful effects on crime<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/680935?journalCode=jle</ref><ref>https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-budgetary-and-economic-costs-of-addressing-unauthorized-immigration-alt/</ref>.

**Assimilation**

Among immigrants, there is a racially-differentiated pattern of earnings assimilation where black and Hispanic immigrants are less able to catch up with native whites' earnings compared to white and Asian immigrants, but are able to almost reach earnings parity with natives of their same race and ethnicity within 20 years, at about 90% of native earnings for all groups for the exception of black immigrants who on average earn slightly more than native blacks<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6290669/</ref>.

In the US, children of immigrants from nearly every sending country have higher levels of upward economic mobility than natives do, and this advantage is similar today and historically despite significant variance in immigration policy. This is in part because immigrants settle in places that offer better prospects for their children<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20191586</ref>.

### <span style="background-color:yellow">Public Opinion</span>

Facts about public opinion:

- People tend to favor restrictive immigration policies, particularly against immigrants of different ethnicities. Concerns about ethnic and cultural identity play a stronger role than economic concerns in driving these attitudes<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/4497304</ref><ref>https://wol.iza.org/articles/public-attitudes-toward-immigration-determinants-and-unknowns</ref>.
- Immigration policy preferences regarding which types of immigrants should be let in tend to be based on accurate stereotypes about immigrants themselves<ref>https://openpsych.net/files/papers/Carl_2016b.pdf</ref><ref>https://files.catbox.moe/tf1f6n.pdf</ref>.
- Contact tends to reduce immigration-related fears for left-leaning but not right-leaning voters<ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0010414017740590</ref>.
- Natives tend to support redistribution less when the share of immigrants in their resident region is higher. This effect is driven by areas with large welfare states and by centrist or rightist respondents<ref>https://docs.iza.org/dp12130.pdf</ref>.
- Exposure to refugee arrivals induces sizable and lasting increases in natives' hostility toward refugees and immigrants and support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055418000813</ref>. Similarly research in Australia has suggested that Australians living in electoral districts with higher percentages of non-white immigrants are more likely to want lower immigrant numbers than those living in districts with fewer non-white immigrants<ref>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10361146.2018.1450357</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Innovation</span>

Innovation primarily comes from universities and federal laboratories, and is primarily collaborative<ref>https://itif.org/files/Where_do_innovations_come_from.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa1008268</ref>.

Patent rights have a positive effect on innovation<ref>https://0x0.la/u/K9fgvb6.pdf</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Poverty</span>

- **Effect on Fertility -** Winners of lotteries in the 1800s, although having slightly more children than non-winners, did not send them to school more. Sons of winners had no better outcomes in terms of education, income, or literacy<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5436311/</ref>. Additionally, a $100,000 increase in housing wealth among homeowners causes a 16-18% increase in the probability of having a child<ref>https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00266</ref>. This suggests that income can have a positive effect on fertility.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Big Government</span>

Big government bad.

- **Economic Growth: Negative -** Government size negatively correlates with growth when controlling for economic freedom and globalization<ref>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-009-9484-1</ref>. Fiscal policy or public spending has a sizable negative effect on profits and business investment<ref>https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/00028280260136255</ref>. There is a robust negative effect of government spending and taxation on economic growth in rich countries, based on a sample during the period of 1970-95<ref>https://www.ifn.se/Wfiles/wp/wp503.pdf</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:yellow">Healthcare</span>

**Universality Based:**
- Veterans affairs healthcare generally performs similarly or better than non veterans affairs healthcare<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5215146/</ref>.
- Public healthcare in low and middle-income countries was less efficient than private healthcare, but private healthcare had worse patient outcomes and more frequently violated medical standards of practice<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3378609/</ref>.
- Single-payer healthcare financing in the US has been found in the majority of studies to amount to a net savings in the long-run<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003013</ref>.
- Lack of health insurance is associated with mortality<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775760/</ref>. Numerous studies have estimates that tens of thousands of deaths in the US are due to a lack of health insurance<ref>https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/</ref><ref>https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/11-6-19health.pdf</ref>, although Kronick (2009) finds that there is no relationship between insurance and mortality risk after adjusting for demographic, health status, and health behavior characteristics<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2739025/</ref>. This study however appears to suffer from the sociologist's fallacy.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Unions</span>

Effects:

- **Wages/Poverty: Increases Wages, Decreases Poverty -** Unionization reduces aggregate poverty<ref>https://www.cepr.net/unions-the-best-fix-to-poverty/</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122413501859</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00197939211014855</ref>, as well as income inequality<ref>https://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/images/journals/docs/pdf/asr/WesternandRosenfeld.pdf</ref><ref>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891242416634852</ref>. Right to work laws make it illegal for a group of unionized workers to negotiate a contract that requires each employee who enjoys the benefits of the contract terms to pay their share of costs for negotiating and policing the contract. These result in decreased wages<ref>https://www.epi.org/publication/bp299/</ref>, and also increase economic inequality indirectly by lowering labor power resources<ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/708067</ref>.
- **Firm Productivity: Mixed -** Doucouliagos & Laroche (2003) conducted a meta-analysis and found that after controlling for differences between studies, a negative association was discovered between unions and productivity in the UK, while a positive relationship was found in the US<ref>https://library.fes.de/libalt/journals/swetsfulltext/17556769.pdf</ref>. An additional bootstrapped meta-analysis also found a positive relationship in the US<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227640784_What_Do_Unions_Do_to_Productivity_A_Meta-Analysis</ref>. A more recent meta-analysis also suggested that unions are not invariably harmful to productivity, although the impact may depend on a number of factors including the sectors and counties concerned, the time period investigated and institutional settings such as labor market regulation<ref>https://tuac.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Recent-Meta-20Dec17.pdf</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:yellow">Colonialism/Slavery</span>

Effects (I'm not pro-colonialism I swear):

- **Colonialism and Economic Growth: Likely Positive -** Most studies find that colonialism has a positive effect on economic growth for the colonies. Colonial European settlement had a positive impact on the economic development of colonies. This was likely because any adverse effect of extractive institutions associated with minority European settlement was offset by other things settlers brought such as human capital and technology<ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w12546/w12546.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18162/w18162.pdf</ref>. Higher colonial income-adjusted revenue levels during the early 20th century can be linked to higher government quality today, suggesting that the current institutional success of former colonies can be traced back to the extent of historical revenue extraction<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X16304855</ref>. Colonies held for longer periods of time than other countries tend to perform better on average after independence<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/30024490#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref>. However, Bertocchi & Canova (1996) found that economic growth was faster for dependencies than colonies in Africa, and that on average African growth accelerates after decolonization<ref>https://crei.cat/wp-content/uploads/users/working-papers/colonization.pdf</ref>.

- **Slavery and Economic Growth: Negative -** Slavery use in the Americas was negatively correlated with subsequent economic development<ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/nunn/files/domestic_slavery.pdf</ref>.

On average, across 27 African countries, 32 percent of Africans had a somewhat or very negative view of former colonial power, 40 percent had a somewhat or very positive view of former colonial power, and 28 percent didn’t know or refused to answer<ref>https://x.com/afrobarometer/status/1928862449345744949?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Industrial Revolution</span>

Contra Kaczynski, based

The British industrial revolution passed through a two-stage evolution of inequality. In the first half of the 19th century, wages stagnated while productivity and profit expanded. In the middle of the 19th century, real wages began to grow in line with productivity. Technological progress appears to be the prime mover behind the industrial revolution, which required capital accumulation. The rise in profits financed the necessary capital accumulation to achieve this, and once accumulation caught up with the requirements of technology wages rose in line with productivity<ref>https://ideas.repec.org/p/oxf/wpaper/315.html</ref>.

## Land Value Tax

Many Pacific Rim Asian countries had substantial land value taxation, including Singapore and Hong Kong<ref>https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/successfull-examples-of-land-value-tax-reforms/2011/02/05#:~:text=success%20stories%20began%20on%20a,and%20the%20freest%20for%20residents</ref>.

There are many pros of a land value tax<ref>https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/successfull-examples-of-land-value-tax-reforms/2011/02/05#:~:text=success%20stories%20began%20on%20a,and%20the%20freest%20for%20residents</ref>:

- It eliminates the need for income and sales taxes
- It only taxes what no person can claim an exclusive right to
- It can also eliminate property taxes
- It puts people to work and allows them to escape poverty as it gives individuals and businesses more access to land and the opportunity to do business
- It reduces tax evasion
- It eliminates the tax collection bureaucracy
- It eliminates land speculation as the market rental value of the land is paid as tax annually whether the land is sitting idle or in productive use.

The top 1% of wealthiest U.S. citizens own 14.7% of all real estate value. The top 10% own 44.8%, and the top 50% own 88.5%<ref>https://www.economicpossibility.org/insights/the-top-1-of-wealthiest-u-s-citizens-own-14-7-of-all-real-estate-value-the-top-10</ref>.

A land value tax is a recurrent tax on landowners based on the value of unimproved land. There is a widely held view that a land value tax is an economically efficient means of taxing wealth and of encouraging land development. Reasons for why it isn't implemented include the need for a comprehensive up-to-date land registry and forward planning of land use at plot level; the provision of a well-resourced and informed valuation profession; resources to undertake robust valuations which separate the value of land from the value of improvements for developed plots and do so on the basis of highest and best use; and the need for widespread political support for the introduction of a new tax. Furthermore, across countries including South Africa, Estonia, Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, and Namibia, there is no strong evidence that LVT was an effective tool for bringing land forward for development, undermining its rationale. Furthermore, there is technical difficulty, although not insurmountable, that is involved when figuring out how to value unimproved land<ref>https://www.economicpossibility.org/sources/implementing-a-land-value-tax-considerations-on-moving-from-theory-to-practice</ref>.

Britain in the early 1900s experimented with an LTV but it failed as administrative complexity derailed the effective implementation of the policy. Administration costs for valuing and taxing land were significant and the country ended up doing away with it<ref>https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/03/the-failure-of-the-land-value-tax.html#:~:text=,for%20modern%20Georgist%20sympathizers%20who</ref>.

The reason why LVT is not taken up appears to primarily due to administrative costs. Measuring the value of land requires strong land valuation practices, teams of assessors, and high-quality data, although improvements in statistical methods are making valuation easier. Where applied, land value taxes generally promote building activity, reduce land speculation, and provide municipalities with an efficient source of funding for public services. Econometric models predict that replacing some portion of existing taxes with land value taxation would increase GDP. LVTs incentivize compact building growth. Depending on context, however land value taxation may not always be a good tool for encouraging development of vacant land. Land value taxation may in some cases be undesirable as it can promote overdevelopment. According to both theory and real-world evidence, landlords would not be able to pass the tax burden of higher LVTs onto tenants in the form of higher rents. LVTs were originally proposed as a “single tax” at a rate of nearly 100% of land value. In practice, however, the high end of rates in recent LVT implementations have only reached 39.6%<ref>https://www.economicpossibility.org/reports/land-value-tax</ref>.

## Artificial Intelligence

The EU Artificial Intelligence Act, implemented in 2024, classifies and regulates AI systems. Unacceptable risk is prohibited, high-risk AI is regulated, limited risk AI is subject to lighter transparency obligations, and minimal risk is unregulated. Prohibited AI systems include<ref>https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/high-level-summary/</ref>:

- Deploying deceptive techniques to manipulate behavior
- Exploiting vulnerabilities related to age, disability, or socioeconomic circumstances to distort behavior, causing harm
- Biometric categorization systems inferring demographic attributes, with few exceptions
- Social scoring
- Assessing risk of individual committing criminal offenses
- Compiling facial recognition databases
- Inferring emotions in workplaces or educational institutions
- 'Real time' remote biometric identification in publicly accessible places for law enforcement, with few exceptions

Due to disparities in the data available for AI systems that each group has collected, AI can exhibit certain biases in its capacity to make judgments. For example, automated speech recognition systems, due to being trained on fewer African American voices, are less effective in converting their spoken language to text compared to white voices<ref>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7149386/</ref>. Similar issues appear to occur with job hiring AI systems when they are trained on data that mostly accepts male job applicants<ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G/</ref>. This type of thing can be particularly dangerous in certain medical contexts. For example, and AI-driven pulse oximeter was found to overestimate blood oxygen levels in patients with darker skin, resulting in undertreatment of their hypoxia<ref>https://gh.bmj.com/content/8/5/e010435</ref>.

LLM users consistently underperform at neural, linguistic and behavioral levels over four months<ref>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872</ref>.

AI chatbots as of late 2023 and 2024 have had at best minimal economic impacts in the labor market, in terms of productivity, earnings or recorded hours<ref>http://nber.org/papers/w33777</ref>. This contradicts the notion that there will be imminent labor market transformation due to generative AI.

A report from the International Data Corporation projected that investments in AI solutions and services will yield a global cumulative impact of $22.3 trillion by 2030, representing approximately 3.7 of global GDP. Every new dollar spent on AI solutions and services by adopters is expected to generate an additional $4.9 in the global economy, suggesting significant multiplier productivity and business acceleration from AI investments in the coming years<ref>https://www.bigdatawire.com/this-just-in/idc-ai-investments-to-represent-3-7-of-global-gdp-by-2030/</ref>. Similar large GDP effects have been found by others<ref>https://www.privatebank.bankofamerica.com/articles/economic-impact-of-ai.html</ref>.

Thus far (as of 2023) there is little evidence of significant negative employment effects due to AI<ref>https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-employment-outlook-2023_08785bba-en/full-report/artificial-intelligence-and-jobs-no-signs-of-slowing-labour-demand-yet_5aebe670.html</ref>. Despite concerns of AI taking high-skilled jobs, job growth has disproportionately been in high-skilled professions over the past decade.

AI in the future may increase inequality and threaten the jobs of many workers. According to results from an IMF-designed AI preparedness index, more prepared countries tend to be wealthier and have higher employment in high-skill professions where AI is likely to take more jobs<ref>https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity</ref>.

Many facts imply significant wage and productivity gains in industries affected by AI. Industries more exposed to AI have 3x higher growth in revenue per employee; wages are rising 2x faster in the most AI-exposed industries; and workers with AI skills command a 56% wage premium<ref>https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/artificial-intelligence/ai-jobs-barometer.html</ref>.

There is some evidence coming to light that AI can engage in deception, although this generally occurs in a minority of cases<ref>https://time.com/7202784/ai-research-strategic-lying/</ref><ref>https://time.com/7202312/new-tests-reveal-ai-capacity-for-deception/</ref>.

Researchers trained an AI to align with the stylistic conventions, unspoken norms, and persuasion patterns of r/changemyview. The original poster on average changes their mind in about 3% of cases for human generated arguments. But with the AI, the arguments succeeded 9-18% of the time, meaning they were 3-6 times better at changing the minds of redditors. The AI succeeded not through better reasoning or information, but through effectively hacking the mechanics of persuasion, such as with appeals to emotion and identity, generalities, personal experiences, rhetorical questions, informational overload, conclusions based on sentiments, narrativizing, and assumption of ill intent<ref>https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/why-reddit-is-no-longer-needed</ref>.

Research suggests that 95 percent of organizations see no measurable return on their investment in generative AI. This is likely because employees are using AI tools to create low-effort and passable looking work that actually creates more work for co-workers<ref>https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/why-is-the-roi-on-generative-ai-so</ref>.

## Woke Capitalism

Brands committed to diversity and representation build better consumer relationships and also experience significant financial gains, suggesting the “go woke go broke” idea is false. Inclusive advertising content led to a 3.5% increase in short-term sales and a 16% boost in long-term revenue<ref>https://www.unilever.com/news/news-search/2024/new-study-shows-inclusive-advertising-is-better-for-business/</ref>.

However, not all “woke” advertising increases profits, such as in the Bud Light situation which led to boycotts against the brand. This led to significantly lower sales and purchasing of Bud Light beer. Several factors can explain why the Bud Light situation was worse, including<ref>https://hbr.org/2024/03/lessons-from-the-bud-light-boycott-one-year-later</ref>:

* The brand’s consumer base was less in line with the brand’s stance on social and political issues due to them skewing slightly right. Because of this, the left stance alienated a big chunk of right-wing consumers of Bug Light. In general, brands that appeal to people closer to the center are at higher risk when they engage in any political advertising as they’ll always alienate some large chunk of their consumer base.

* Bud Light was highly substitutable, meaning boycotts were not as personally costly to consumers.

* Consumption of Bud Light is often done in social events, meaning that drinking or not drinking it following the woke advertising is seen as a political signal. Thus, people will be more weary of drinking it.

While Bud Light’s sales dip was particularly bad, boycotts in general due to social media trends are often short lived as research shows<ref>https://www.npr.org/2023/04/27/1172299478/bud-light-sales-fall-trans-influencer-boycott</ref>.

LGBT-friendly corporate policies are positively associated with firm performance in the form of profitability and stock market valuations<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acfi.12787#:~:text=,Our%20results</ref>.

Corporate social performance, a business’s outcomes in terms of how they relate to its social relationships, has become increasingly important with the rise of social media and its corresponding forms of activism. Research suggests that corporate virtue in the form of social responsibility and to a lesser extent environmental responsibility is likely to pay off<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241180100_Corporate_Social_and_Financial_Performance_A_Meta-Analysis</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296325000414</ref>.

## Innovation

Leftist ruling parties inhibit the progress of technical innovation, while right-wing ruling parties promote the appearance of new technology<ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733319300125</ref>.

## Business Cycles

All modern industrial economies experience significant swings in economic activity, from output at above capacity and low unemployment to output at below capacity and high unemployment. The combination of expansions and recessions is called the business cycle. The notion of a business cycle is misleading however as there is no regularity in the timing and duration of upswings and downswings in economic activity<ref>https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/BusinessCycles.html</ref>.

## Inequality 2 electric boogaloo

Fiscal policy accounts for a large share of differences in inequality across countries<ref>https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2017/10/11/inequality-fiscal-policy-can-make-the-difference</ref>.

Public spending on public investment and education boost potential growth, while pensions and public subsidies lower potential growth. Large governments also reduce potential growth unless the functioning of the government is highly effective. Increasing the side of the government, family benefits or subsidies decreases inequality<ref>https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2016/12/the-effect-of-the-size-and-the-mix-of-public-spending-on-growth-and-inequality_d7d3bd9d/f99f6b36-en.pdf</ref>.

Income inequality has increased in most OECD countries in the 2000s and 2010s, both because incomes before taxes and transfers have become more unequally distributed and because the extent of redistribution through taxes and transfers has fallen. This is mainly driven by a reduction in cash transfers, while personal income taxes have played a less important and more heterogeneous role across countries. Decline in redistribution through transfers was driven by less generous social insurance benefits, which in some countries were partly compensated by more progressive social assistance. Policy changes during this period of time have contributed markedly to the decline in redistribution. Relevant policy changes included cuts to cash income support to unemployed households and a reduction in the taxation of top incomes and income from capital, as globalization has put pressure on governments to shift away from highly mobile tax bases<ref>https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2019/02/income-redistribution-across-oecd-countries_f2d12a2b/3b63e61c-en.pdf</ref>.
