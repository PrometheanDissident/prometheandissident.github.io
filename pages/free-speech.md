## On the Importance of Freedom of Speech

Many view freedom of speech as a good merely because it gives people freedom to say things which do not directly harm others. If speech cannot directly harm others, it should be protected. While this view, which holds that something can only be restricted if it's demonstrated to harm others, is a reasonable view to have, it does not truly grasp the significance of freedom of speech. It merely reduces free speech to "the ability to do stuff", without considering what is so positive about freedom of speech.

Freedom of speech is a positive for the same reason that evolution is a positive. Where evolution allows organisms to better adapt to their environments over time, maximizing survival, freedom of speech allows ideas to be exchanged, which can lead to society evolving and improving over time in a similar manner. The ability to speak ideas is a prerequisite to societal evolution, as in order for society to change in an explicit manner there must be the ability for people to explicitly describe and argue in favor of that change. Societies which severely restrict freedom of speech, only allowing views which are already in the status quo, will struggle to advance in any meaningful way. Freedom of speech allows people to generate ideas, test them, and adopt or reject them based on whether they survive argumentation. It allows curiosity and discovery to be freely engaged in. It is thus not surprising that greater freedom of speech is associated with higher innovation<ref>http://justitia-int.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Analyse_Ytringsfrihed-Hvad-skal-det-nytte.pdf</ref>.

Similarly, freedom of speech allows people to express problems in a non-violent manner. In a sense, it civilizes people. This is because the absence of freedom of speech means that people no longer feel like they are able to discuss their problems or grievances in society, and so people will resort to forms of overt coersion to have their grievances heard. This can manifest in forms of violence or terrorism. It is not a surprise that the viewpoints which are oftentimes associated with higher rates of violence are those outside the mainstream. While some of these worldviews can be inherently violence-promoting, it is also the case that feeling like you can't express yourself in public without fear of ostracism can drive one towards violence. Freedom of speech allows grievances to be discussed, negotiated, and incorporated into society in a peaceful manner. This is backed up empirically. Eskildsen & Bjørnskov (2020) looked at a panel of 162 countries between 1970-2016 and found that discussion freedom is unambiguously associated with less terrorism in democracies<ref>https://futurefreespeech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Freedom-of-Expression-and-Terror-Apr-4.pdf</ref>. Another study suggested that there is no connection between the protection of freedom of expression and radicalization and terror<ref>http://justitia-int.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Analyse_Ytringsfrihed-Hvad-skal-det-nytte.pdf</ref>.

Freedom of speech, like any other right, requires both enforcement by the state as well as a general cultural infrastructure which upholds the right. Freedom of speech doesn't exist substantively if the state actively prohibits it and suppresses anyone who engages in speech. Even if a person has the literal freedom to speak, in that they are not immediately physically prevented from speaking, the coersion of knowing that one will be punished for doing so means that freedom of speech does not exist in any substantive way. Similarly, freedom of speech doesn't exist substantively if the broader culture doesn't support it. If through exercising freedom of speech one puts themselves at high risk of social ostracism, loss of employment, and general impoverishment, the coersion of knowing that one will be punished for freedom of speech means that is does not substantively exist, even if there is no state apparatus actively suppressing free speech. Thus, it is crucial that not only the state generally protect freedom of speech, but the general population must also recognize its importance and not prevent it from substantively existing.

Rights come with responsibilities. The right to freedom of speech, the right to the benefits it provides to society, also requires a responsibility for people to engage in it fruitfully. While freedom of speech can be used for immense positive developments and promote rationality, it can also be used to promote irrationality and other harmful things if abused. In extreme cases, it can lead to violence or oppression in a direct or indirect manner. For responsible use of free speech to be promoted and supercede irresponsible uses, a culture around freedom of speech and broader discourse must come with the protection of such a right by the state. Perhaps the best sets of broad norms for discourse was compiled by Kenneth Westhues, who took ideas from Alastair Roberts and Steve Sailer, referred to as modern discourse (see [Mobbing and Other Group Dynamics](https://prometheandissident.github.io/psychology/#mobbing-and-other-group-dynamics) for a more extensive discussion on how this is practiced or not practiced today)<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/regiftedxmas12.html</ref>:

- Personal detachment from the issues under discussion
- Values on confidence, originality, agonism, independence of thought, creativity, assertiveness, mastery of one’s feelings, a thick skin and high tolerance for your own and others’ discomfort
- Playfulness is legitimate: One can play devil’s advocate, speak tongue in cheek, overstate and use hyperbole, the object being not to capture the truth in a single, balanced monologue, but to expose the strengths and weaknesses of various positions
- Scathing satire and sharp criticism are also legitimate
- The best ideas are thought to emerge from mutual, merciless probing and attacking of arguments
- Participants are repeatedly forced to return to the drawing board and produce better arguments
- The truth is not to be located in a single voice but rather is to emerge from the conversation as a whole

A couple of other values I would add onto these which I would view as important would include sincerity and an absence of contrarianism for the sake of contrarianism. These two are somewhat interrelated. By these, I mean that people should geniunely hold the beliefs they do, and only engage in playfulness for the sake of intellectual progress as opposed to for the sake of trolling. Similarly, contrarianism should not be engaged in for its own sake, but once again should only be engaged in through dialectic processes where a better understanding of something can emerge at the end. These values have been somewhat under threat simply due to the greater amount of time people spend online, which due to its greater anonymity tends to breed these issues. With the internet increasingly being viewed as more important than the real world, these problems can bleed into the real world to an extent that they may not have previously done so. Similarly, civility is an extremely important value to have in dialectic, so long as it doesn't come at the expense of the pursuit of truth. Uncomfortable truths should not be expressed in a manner designed to elicit a response from someone else. Civility has similarly been undermining with the rise of the internet.

With a legal protection of freedom of speech and a broader cultural framework which allows it to be used in an effective manner, free and open dialogue can be used productively. Freedom of speech is one of the most important values any society that wishes to progress should have.

## Threats to Free Speech

Because freedom of speech can be viewed as a positive right which can be violated at both a state level as well as a cultural level, threats to freedom of speech can manifest themselves at a number of levels. I identify four levels of note, which include the state, corporations, academia, and the general public (note that this list draws heavily from T. K. Van Allen's analysis in his article on freedom of speech<ref>https://zerocontradictions.net/pdfs/freedom-of-speech.pdf</ref>). These will be discussed in order:

- **The State -** The most obvious way in which freedom of speech can be violated or suppressed is through the state. The imposition of deliberate restrictions on the ability for people to express certain ideas or talk about certain things under threat of force by the state is perhaps the most egregious way in which freedom of speech can be violated. A less egregious form of violation of freedom of speech which can occur depending on state laws is the suppression of speech through lawfare, as what happened with the anti-immigration website VDARE<ref>https://vdare.com/</ref>. This can occur when dubiously valid legal attacks are consistently levied against an individual or entity, requiring the recipient to continously pay vast sums of money to cover legal funds associated with their defense. Through slowly whittling away at their income and causing impoverishment, lawfare of this form can effectively lead to the suppression of certain voices.
- **Corporations -** Corporations, through engaging in viewpoint discrimination against individuals in hiring processes, or through firing individuals already employed, effectively coercing individuals into silence through economic soft power. Beyond this, there is the threat which corporations pose insofar as they control various platforms and mediums for communication. A particularly important instance of this is with social media, where a large debate over the past decade has surrounded whether deplatforming certain individuals can ever be justified. Social media companies which ban individuals for expressing certain viewpoints can effectively silence certain viewpoints. Beyond the economic effects of deplatforming individuals whose careers are often built on having large online audiences through these platforms, deplatforming can cut off certain viewpoints from being seen in what is currently one of the most fundamental mediums of communication. Because this medium is privatized, this opens up the opportunity for private entities to limit freedom of speech.
- **Academia -** Academia is similar to corporations in that it can engage in viewpoint discrimination in hiring and firing, as well as in more soft means such as promotion for awards. This happens regularly in practice (see [Political Bias in Academia](https://prometheandissident.github.io/academia/#political-bias-in-academia)). What makes academia unique is that unlike corporate jobs which are in many cases held by individuals without strong expertise, or general social media platforms where anyone can talk, is that academia is a type of gatekeeper. Because academia is uniquely associated with prestige, it gatekeeps whose voices are regarded as ones which should be taken seriously. Furthermore, the broader system provides individuals with professional positions where they can conduct research on various topics. It is unique in that it pays individuals for producing knowledge, which is significantly more time-consuming, costly, but also valuable, relative to general dialectic which may be seen on an online platform. Gatekeeping of academia not only gatekeeps legitimacy to a degree, but it also gatekeeps the capacity for individuals to engage in research. In this respect, violations of free speech in academia are worse than corporate violations, as the chilling effects not only affect speech, but also the capacity to produce knowledge.
- **The General Public -** While less talked about today, it has been widely recognized by a number of liberal philosophers, such as John Stuart Mill, Alexis de Tocqueville, Bertrand Russell, that the "tyranny of the majority" can act as a way to stifle free speech in itself<ref>https://necpluribusimpar.net/censorship-is-bad-even-when-its-done-by-private-companies/</ref>. In conjunction with threat of losing platforms, loss of employment in academia and elsewhere, social pressures to conform to societal dogmas can be immense, should such dogmas exist. While anonymity can help alleviate some of these problems, anonymously speaking about controversial subjects publicly inevitably breeds the risk of doxxing, which risks bringing social and economic costs to speech. In extreme cases, individual acts of terrorism or mob violence against individuals can also lead to a dampening on freedom of speech. Risk of violence from private individuals if one speaks out can effectively silence many individuals.

## How to Have Freedom of Speech as a Positive Good




- Discuss how free speech can exhibit "democratic" qualities to it, which means that bad ideas can win out if people are irrational (ex. myth of rational voter)
- Free speech can arguably be used to silence others, if it attempts to exclude them from conversation or intimidate them. Discuss this from a left-wing or right-wing perspective, explain which one is correct, and connect it to the notion of the paradox of tolerance and how it's been misinterpreted and abused.



- Discuss freedom of speech as a positive right which needs to be culturally protected. People need to be culturally tolerant, and also engage in speech which is condusive to the fluorishing of society
- Speech is not simply a right but also a responsibility

- Paradox of tolerance

## The Limits of Freedom of Speech

- Discuss ethics of limiting "hate speech", corporations engaging in censorship particularly in social media platforms
- Pluralism should be preferred when navigating challenges associated with productive speech, and this necessitates fewer legal boundaries being imposed
- X/twitter in its current form has advantages and disadvantages
- Maybe discuss ways we can protect freedom of speech even when there is suppression? For example, look at anonymity
- We probably don't need too much regulation at this point - twitter is based and we probably need diversity of approaches

## <span style="background-color:orange">Effects</span>

Eskildsen & Bjørnskov (2020) looked at a panel of 162 countries between 1970-2016 and found that discussion freedom is unambiguously associated with less terrorism in democracies<ref>https://futurefreespeech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Freedom-of-Expression-and-Terror-Apr-4.pdf</ref>. Another study suggested that there is no connection between the protection of freedom of expression and radicalization and terror<ref>http://justitia-int.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Analyse_Ytringsfrihed-Hvad-skal-det-nytte.pdf</ref>. Concern about societal conflict and violence arising from freedom of expression only finds empirical support in the most closed societies, where limited liberalizations of freedom of expression may be able to promote societal conflict. The same study suggested that freedom of expression is associated with general protection of human rights, lower levels of corruption, better democratic conditions, and increased innovation. This is consistent with the idea that most restrictions on freedom of expression are used as a tool to safeguard the interests of society's most powerful people.

It should be noted however that we have to be careful about how the notion of freedom of speech/expression is operationalized. Both studies discussed above put Denmark at the top of the list for freedom of expression, because while the country has generally high acceptance of restrictions on freedom of expression when it comes to minority groups of radical political and religious movements, it also has the highest support for the protection of freedom of expression. This means that it is dubious to use this data to argue against hate speech laws, as it appears that they aren't looking at that as a major issue when it comes to ranking countries.
