## On the Importance of Freedom of Speech

Many view freedom of speech as a good merely because it gives people freedom to say things which do not directly harm others. If speech cannot directly harm others, it should be protected. While this view, which holds that something can only be restricted if it's demonstrated to harm others, is a reasonable view to have, it does not truly grasp the significance of freedom of speech. It merely reduces free speech to "the ability to do stuff", without considering what is so positive about freedom of speech.

Freedom of speech is a positive for the same reason that evolution is a positive. Where evolution allows organisms to better adapt to their environments over time, maximizing survival, freedom of speech allows ideas to be exchanged, which can lead to society evolving and improving over time in a similar manner. The ability to speak ideas is a prerequisite to societal evolution, as in order for society to change in an explicit manner there must be the ability for people to explicitly describe and argue in favor of that change. Societies which severely restrict freedom of speech, only allowing views which are already in the status quo, will struggle to advance in any meaningful way. Freedom of speech allows people to generate ideas, test them, and adopt or reject them based on whether they survive argumentation. It allows curiosity and discovery to be freely engaged in. It is thus not surprising that greater freedom of speech is associated with higher innovation<ref>http://justitia-int.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Analyse_Ytringsfrihed-Hvad-skal-det-nytte.pdf</ref>.

Freedom of speech, like any other right, requires both enforcement by the state as well as a general cultural infrastructure which upholds the right. Freedom of speech doesn't exist substantively if the state actively prohibits it and suppresses anyone who engages in speech. Even if a person has the literal freedom to speak, in that they are not immediately physically prevented from speaking, the coersion of knowing that one will be punished for doing so means that freedom of speech does not exist in any substantive way. Similarly, freedom of speech doesn't exist substantively if the broader culture doesn't support it. If through exercising freedom of speech one puts themselves at high risk of social ostracism, loss of employment, and general impoverishment, the coersion of knowing that one will be punished for freedom of speech means that is does not substantively exist, even if there is no state apparatus actively suppressing free speech. Thus, it is crucial that not only the state generally protect freedom of speech, but the general population must also recognize its importance and not prevent it from substantively existing.

Rights come with responsibilities. The right to freedom of speech, the right to the benefits it provides to society, also requires a responsibility for people to engage in it fruitfully. While freedom of speech can be used for immense positive developments and promote rationality, it can also be used to promote irrationality and other harmful things if abused. In extreme cases, it can lead to violence or oppression in a direct or indirect manner. For responsible use of free speech to be promoted and supercede irresponsible uses, a culture around freedom of speech and broader discourse must come with the protection of such a right by the state. Perhaps the best sets of broad norms for discourse was compiled by Kenneth Westhues, who took ideas from Alastair Roberts and Steve Sailer, referred to as modern discourse (see [Mobbing and Other Group Dynamics](https://prometheandissident.github.io/psychology/#mobbing-and-other-group-dynamics) for a more extensive discussion on how this is practiced or not practiced today)<ref>https://www.kwesthues.com/regiftedxmas12.html</ref>:

- Personal detachment from the issues under discussion
- Values on confidence, originality, agonism, independence of thought, creativity, assertiveness, mastery of one’s feelings, a thick skin and high tolerance for your own and others’ discomfort
- Playfulness is legitimate: One can play devil’s advocate, speak tongue in cheek, overstate and use hyperbole, the object being not to capture the truth in a single, balanced monologue, but to expose the strengths and weaknesses of various positions
- Scathing satire and sharp criticism are also legitimate
- The best ideas are thought to emerge from mutual, merciless probing and attacking of arguments
- Participants are repeatedly forced to return to the drawing board and produce better arguments
- The truth is not to be located in a single voice but rather is to emerge from the conversation as a whole

A couple of other values I would add onto these which I would view as important would include sincerity and an absence of contrarianism for the sake of contrarianism. These two are somewhat interrelated. By these, I mean that people should geniunely hold the beliefs they do, and only engage in playfulness for the sake of intellectual progress as opposed to for the sake of trolling. Similarly, contrarianism should not be engaged in for its own sake, but once again should only be engaged in through dialectic processes where a better understanding of something can emerge at the end. These values have been somewhat under threat simply due to the greater amount of time people spend online, which due to its greater anonymity tends to breed these issues. With the internet increasingly being viewed as more important than the real world, these problems can bleed into the real world to an extent that they may not have previously done so. Similarly, politeness is an extremely important value to have in dialectic, so long as it doesn't come at the expense of the pursuit of truth. Uncomfortable truths should not be expressed in a manner designed to elicit a response from someone else. Politeness has similarly been undermining with the rise of the internet.

With a legal protection of freedom of speech and a broader cultural framework which allows it to be used in an effective manner, free and open dialogue can be used productively. Freedom of speech is one of the most important values any society that wishes to progress should have.

## Threats to Free Speech

- Discuss how freedom of speech can reduce violence, as by allowing people to voice their grievances and feel heard they feel less of a need to engage in violence




- Discuss freedom of speech as a positive right which needs to be culturally protected. People need to be culturally tolerant, and also engage in speech which is condusive to the fluorishing of society
- Speech is not simply a right but also a responsibility
- Threats to free speech can come from the state, society, or corporations in theory

- Paradox of tolerance

## The Limits of Freedom of Speech

- Discuss ethics of limiting "hate speech", corporations engaging in censorship particularly in social media platforms
- Pluralism should be preferred when navigating challenges associated with productive speech, and this necessitates fewer legal boundaries being imposed
- X/twitter in its current form has advantages and disadvantages

Eskildsen & Bjørnskov (2020) looked at a panel of 162 countries between 1970-2016 and found that discussion freedom is unambiguously associated with less terrorism in democracies<ref>https://futurefreespeech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Freedom-of-Expression-and-Terror-Apr-4.pdf</ref>. Another study suggested that there is no connection between the protection of freedom of expression and radicalization and terror<ref>http://justitia-int.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Analyse_Ytringsfrihed-Hvad-skal-det-nytte.pdf</ref>. Concern about societal conflict and violence arising from freedom of expression only finds empirical support in the most closed societies, where limited liberalizations of freedom of expression may be able to promote societal conflict. The same study suggested that freedom of expression is associated with general protection of human rights, lower levels of corruption, better democratic conditions, and increased innovation. This is consistent with the idea that most restrictions on freedom of expression are used as a tool to safeguard the interests of society's most powerful people.

It should be noted however that we have to be careful about how the notion of freedom of speech/expression is operationalized. Both studies discussed above put Denmark at the top of the list for freedom of expression, because while the country has generally high acceptance of restrictions on freedom of expression when it comes to minority groups of radical political and religious movements, it also has the highest support for the protection of freedom of expression. This means that it is dubious to use this data to argue against hate speech laws, as it appears that they aren't looking at that as a major issue when it comes to ranking countries.
