## On the Importance of Freedom of Speech

- Discuss why freedom of speech is necessary as a means to challenge and debate ideas
- Use evolution as an analogy

## Threats to Free Speech

- Discuss freedom of speech as a positive right which needs to be culturally protected. People need to be culturally tolerant, and also engage in speech which is condusive to the fluorishing of society
- Speech is not simply a right but also a responsibility
- Threats to free speech can come from the state, society, or corporations in theory

## The Limits of Freedom of Speech

- Discuss ethics of limiting "hate speech", corporations engaging in censorship particularly in social media platforms
- Pluralism should be preferred when navigating challenges associated with productive speech, and this necessitates fewer legal boundaries being imposed

Eskildsen & Bjørnskov (2020) looked at a panel of 162 countries between 1970-2016 and found that discussion freedom is unambiguously associated with less terrorism in democracies<ref>https://futurefreespeech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Freedom-of-Expression-and-Terror-Apr-4.pdf</ref>. Another study suggested that there is no connection between the protection of freedom of expression and radicalization and terror<ref>http://justitia-int.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Analyse_Ytringsfrihed-Hvad-skal-det-nytte.pdf</ref>. Concern about societal conflict and violence arising from freedom of expression only finds empirical support in the most closed societies, where limited liberalizations of freedom of expression may be able to promote societal conflict. The same study suggested that freedom of expression is associated with general protection of human rights, lower levels of corruption, better democratic conditions, and increased innovation. This is consistent with the idea that most restrictions on freedom of expression are used as a tool to safeguard the interests of society's most powerful people.

It should be noted however that we have to be careful about how the notion of freedom of speech/expression is operationalized. Both studies discussed above put Denmark at the top of the list for freedom of expression, because while the country has generally high acceptance of restrictions on freedom of expression when it comes to minority groups of radical political and religious movements, it also has the highest support for the protection of freedom of expression. This means that it is dubious to use this data to argue against hate speech laws, as it appears that they aren't looking at that as a major issue when it comes to ranking countries.
