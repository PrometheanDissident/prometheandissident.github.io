## Culture

The rudiments of culture exist in other primates but culture infiltrating virtually all aspects of life is exclusive to humans. There is great amounts of cultural diversity among societies. Culture, including ritual and religion, can be interpreted as a hierarchical system of “environmental tracking devices”, or responses. The fastest cultural responses in industrial societies include fashions on dress and speech. Slower are political ideology and attitudes toward other nations, and slowest includes incest taboos or belief/disbelief in higher gods. Slowly changing forms of culture tend to be encapsulated in rituals. Most human rituals have more than a simple immediate signal value. They both label, reaffirm and rejuvenate the moral values of the community. The most elementary forms of sacred rituals are concerned with magic, or the active attempt to manipulate nature and the gods<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

Formal religion is focused on deeper and more tribally oriented beliefs. Its rites celebrate creation myths, attempt to win the favor of the gods, and resanctify moral codes. In more complex societies, polity and religion blend naturally, as kings rule by divine right but high priests often ruled over kinds by the higher rank of the gods<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

It is reasonable to infer that magic and totemism are direct adaptations to the environment and preceded formal religion in social evolution. Sacred traditions are a cultural universal as are creation myths or at least myths which situation the tribe in relation to the world. Belief in high gods is not universal however. One analysis found that only about 35 percent of hunter-gatherer societies included high gods in their sacred traditions<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.

“To sanctify a procedure or statement is to certify it as beyond question and imply punishment for anyone who dares to contradict it.” This certification is used to serve the most important interests of the group. Another force leading to the formalization of morality and religion is the fact that extreme human social plasticity can be both a strength and a danger. If trusted to make rules on their own, a person risks chaos<ref>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis | Ch. 26 - Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology</ref>.
