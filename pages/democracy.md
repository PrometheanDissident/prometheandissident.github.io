## <span style="background-color:orange">Public Opinion and Political Change</span>

The impact of public opinion on public policy is substantial, and salience of issues enhances the impact. This impact remains strong even when the activities of political organizations and elites are taken into account<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3219881#metadata_info_tab_contents</ref><ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/effects-of-public-opinion-on-policy/856B172A7DC19A7EB72C569A7F6F2104</ref>. Policy also drives public opinion, as the public naturally responds positively or negatively to policy changes by the government<ref>https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-74</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Stability</span>

Democracies are less warlike than other regimes, particularly in terms of the severity of war<ref>https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/DP95.HTM</ref>.

Polities with higher levels of democracy are more likely to be politically stable<ref>https://www.jstor.org/stable/intesociscierevi.90.1.01</ref>.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Economic Growth</span>

There is very clearly a positive correlation between democracy and economic growth. However, there is a lot of debate about the causal direction, if there is a causal relationship at all<ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00299.x</ref><ref>https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/700936</ref><ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984317308093</ref><ref>https://0x0.la/u/fcovCUN.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.columbia.edu/~flr9/documents/Rivera-Batiz_Democracy_Governance_Growth.pdf</ref><ref>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2014/05/democracy-boost-economic-growth/</ref><ref>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-5907.00023</ref><ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/democracy-political-stability-and-economic-growth/1630FBD0E7690CAF595EE9C612E405AE</ref><ref>https://www.democracy.uci.edu/files/docs/conferences/grad/chen.pdf</ref><ref>https://scholar.harvard.edu/jrobinson/files/jr_econdevelopment.pdf</ref>. I would need to examine this question further to form a stronger opinion on it, although a lot of the mechanisms discussed below in studies for how democracy causes economic growth seem intuitively correct to me. It is clear that while the precise economic effects of democracy have not been determined, it is very unlikely that democracy has negative effects on economic growth. In order to even begin to establish such a relationship, it would first need to be shown that there was a negative correlation between democracy and economic growth, and the existing evidence suggests the exact reverse.

## <span style="background-color:orange">Populism</span>

The longer both right- and left-wing populists are in power, the greater inflation becomes. Inflation is worse under left-wing populists than right-wing populists, but both are still worse than moderate leaders<ref>https://hbr.org/2024/10/when-populists-rise-economies-often-fall</ref>.

Populism can be understood as a political strategy that focuses on the conflict between “the people” and “the elites”. A leader is considered populist if they place the alleged struggle of the people against the elites as the center of their political campaign and governing style. Populism at the country level has been around for over 100 years but has reached a historical high recently. It is associated with lower growth rates over the next 5 years after a populist gains power, as well as the next 15 years. Populism is also costly for democratic institutions, being associated with a decline in checks and balances when populist leaders get into power among both left and right-wing cases, as well as lower electoral and press freedoms. Populist leaders rarely leave office without drama, disregarding democratic procedures. Economic nationalism (protectionism) and disintegration (unsustainable macroeconomic policies resulting in spiraling public debt and inflation) are the two main ways in which populist governments harm growth<ref>https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/cost-populism-evidence-history</ref>.

There is a negative association between educational attainment and support for radical right-wing populist parties, but not for radical left-wing or other types of populists. This suggests it is not the populist message of right-wing populist political parties that attracts lower-educated voters, but their nativism<ref>https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/45896/chapter-abstract/437004119?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false</ref>.

Populism is closely related to societal polarization, as there is a high correlation between public opinion regarding the division of society between “ordinary people and the corrupt elites who exploit them” and social polarization<ref>https://www.idea.int/blog/explainer-populism-left-and-right-progressive-and-regressive</ref>.

On average, ordinary democratic governments remain for about 3 years. However, populist governments on average manage to sustain their hold for about 6.5 years, more than double as long. Populists are also more likely to win re-election once or twice and more likely to remain in power for well over a decade. Among populist leaders who entered office between 1990 and 2015, only a small minority left office as a result of the normal democratic process. 50 percent of populists either rewrote or amended their country’s constitution when they gained power, frequently with the aim of eliminating presidential term limits and reducing checks and balances on executive power. Populist rule is associated with lower press freedom, civil liberties, and political rights. In terms of danger to democratic institutions, left-wing populists do not appear to fare much better than right-wing populists<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/hard-data-populism-bolsonaro-trump/578878/</ref>.

Economic shocks from globalization can help to fuel populism, and helped Trump win the 2016 presidential election<ref>https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-070220-032416</ref>.

There is also some evidence suggesting that cultural backlash contributes to the rise of populism<ref>https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/trump-brexit-and-rise-populism-economic-have-nots-and-cultural-backlash</ref>.
